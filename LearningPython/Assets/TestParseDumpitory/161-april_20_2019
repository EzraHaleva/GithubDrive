The life goal, what we should pursue in the moment, is not happiness but what is good for our soul. There is something wrong with us, we are in exile after all. Happiness in this state is never true happiness. What we can do to be content is heal our soul, do what is good for it. This means follow God, follow what you know is good. When I say this I’m reminded of the misery I might feel and the nihilism that will say “fuck it, let’s just watch YouTube what’s the point anyway”. That voice, that lack of awareness is a poison. Even now, I feel the lack of awareness – so focus. Good, get back your awareness of what we should do and pursue.
