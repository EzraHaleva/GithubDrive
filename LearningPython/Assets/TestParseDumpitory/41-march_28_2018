On the bus back from tel Aviv. I haven’t done much productively for past 3 days, though it is vacation time so it is permissible. I’ll keep reading at the very least. Matt also seems to be bullshitting. The obsession men have with girls as if they contribute to happiness is total nonsense. I think I’ll stop engaging Matt as much and let him find his own way to get his shit together. Like a parent with a child gone astray, the only thing you can do is let them find their own path. Hopefully his positive regard for me is enough so that my anger didn’t uproot the seeds of success from monk mode and everything. As for myself, the one thing I must do every day is work on translating the prayer. For now,my source of translation will just be sefaria, but I should find some artscroll pictures or something.

So I ended up heavily smoking hookah with frenchy. I feel impure when I do this. I’ve stopped it in monk mode. 

4:34 next day

Just had a wet dream. To impair the mind is to submerse in weakness, to turn off the light. No drinking. No hookah. I will have an unimpaired mind.
