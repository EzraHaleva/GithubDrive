4 next day

Well, we've fapped again. There is no longer anything left to think. It has all been thought. When the urge arises tomorrow, and it will, remember your motivations. The world is beautiful without it, Valhalla awaits, and the terror and regret that will result if we break it. Just because I don’t feel terror now, does not mean I am not terrified. I will be, just wait tomorrow we will see what terrifies me. I will look fat. I will behavior mediocre, despite my best efforts to embody the confident true self I once knew. Carry this motivation with you, like a torch growing brighter and burning stronger. When you next fap, go outside and walk. When you next look negatively at the potential work ahead of you – gym, translation, prayer – know that it is in these things that we will find grace, security, and happiness. It is in sleep, right now, that I will find grace. Tomorrow it is in prayer and gym and translation of prayer and coding and reading that I will find grace. The true battle is not the beginning, the true battle is at around 3 weeks. Once your mind has accustomed to it’s true self, you will be faced with inadequacy, with unachievable happiness because of malpractice. The time is now, right now, to fix your life. No longer tomorrow. No longer waiting for the next day, the next chunk of time. Renounced forever, to the life of happiness. No symbolic meaning, but ineffable existence in true intention. Not every day is a battle, not every hour, not every second but every instant. Each infinitesimal moment is a battle, and one we must win unquestionably. Good day and good night.
