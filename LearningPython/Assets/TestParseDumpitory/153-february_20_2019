I haven’t put a day counter up because I'm afraid putting a 0 might deceive and entice me to relapse, while a 1js disingenuous. I haven’t journaled in over a month, nofap is on a 36 day streak, though I was very close last night and urges still present this morning. I went on Kik and Omegle again, thank God I didn’t get any nudes. Also had a good streak going of waking up at 5:30. When I start that again, I need to focus especially on meaningful work. I also need to investigate clubs literally asap. There is a longing in my heart. I feel alone. And yet we have control over this, we should be able to just be happy, but we lose sight of things. Even now, my negative conception is bullshit. I need my own fucking room too, or someone who wakes up as early as me at least. Not this 9am bullshit. Honestly don’t know if there’s anything useful to right rn. I’d like to focus on essays about theory in here moving forward. Instead of responding to people on Reddit, respond to yourself.
