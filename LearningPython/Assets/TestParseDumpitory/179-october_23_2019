Today I did indulge in some crap, some youtube or twitter or reddit, but stuck well to my diet and gym program. I didn’t have balls to approach most girls, but I was close. I contacted some girls on my phone and got not real responses – they aren’t so interested. Today, I didn’t feel loved but I also feel more in touch with my emotions. I feel there’s a path forward. Unhappiness paired with content and tranquility is truly not a bad program.
