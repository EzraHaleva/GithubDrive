It seems I won’t be seeing my application decision until later. The only solution then is to recover from the horrible binge, and proceed as if accepted. I must continue to code, I must reclaim my life regardless of college. All the progress I’ve made with staying in reality may be lost. This is terrible. I can never let something like this happen again.
