So, I’m 19. I don’t see this as a time to reflect though, it’s only another arbitrary day. As for relevant things the most important is my programming. My progress is still slow as I pursue perfection I tried working today but ultimately worked very little. I’ve begun to settle into my proper self though. I just felt a huge urge though, and though I’m tempted it is still this moment that I do not give in. Tomorrow I will wake up stronger or weaker. An urge is a test, a choice between mediocrity and greatness and I must take this chance to rise to greatness.
