It’s dawned on me that all of my motivation is rather short lived, in the span of a week or two, because it doesn’t apply well to the right now. The grandiose motivational incentive of a better life or of prophecy needs to be met with a short term reward. Or my frame so long term that I can accurately envision a cycle of hell from which I never escape that is relapse and mediocrity without that which matters truly, prophecy. In my head I’ll justify relapse. “Its just one day”. The answer is not to foolishly imagine that one day equals many, for it is true one day is only one day. Rather, we should truly perceive the value of a single day. It should be thus that my rewards aren’t only in the future, but immediate. Perhaps an immediate benefit to my soul. The philosophy I take on should produce the same behavior if today is assumed to be our last day or if it is assumed we live till 100.
