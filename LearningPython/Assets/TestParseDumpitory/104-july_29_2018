I think I’ve got something going now. Have certainly not been perfect. Watched YouTube videos, ate garbage, the works, but I’m water fasting now and very excited. The fatigue makes resistance easy if I’m honest. I also still feel terrified of not being productive. Maybe a therapist would be good for me? Idk. At least for the moment I won’t have access to one and going to a therapist at Rutgers would be an orwellian nightmare. I think I need simply look to the Torah. I’m excited I’m doing the translation at least. Or I have the artscroll with which to do it.
