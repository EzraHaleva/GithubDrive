So this entire past weekend I’ve been paralyzed by the stress of rutgers. I felt I needed all the youtube and crap to cope. It’s because I can’t think my way out of this one, any work I’d do towards a solution will be meaningless. I simply need to wait until the decision comes out, then I’ll have a stable life to work towards improving.
