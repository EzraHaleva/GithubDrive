I just fapped. I don’t even know what happened. I just lost all vigor, all my fight. I had nothing to live for. I’m in a job I don’t like, working on a project with no direction, and no ability to move forward. This is an opportunity though. I’ll now pursue complete extreme, the perfection I’ve so desperately been seeking. Anything is possible now, but don’t feel pleasure from this. Pleasure in any form will be your downfall. Cold showers every morning, then pray, then workout, then work. After 1 hour of work we may eat. That will be the schedule from now on, no excuse. On Shabbat we will wake up, cold shower, pray, then read faur. During this time and utterly no form of online anything. A YouTube video must be directly related to work. No Joey Diaz, no fortnite, no Reddit. This companionship is “needes” only as an excuse to hide from the void, face your susceptibility to sexual arousement but don’t think on it. We fail every time because we are loose, there is no discipline. We wake up and sloth, get home and sloth. Time matters – use it.
