Journal Check in. Woke up earlier today which is good. Still tired, still not wanting to do work. Still have that inclination towards crap. Haven’t touched Zarathustra because reading seems so unbearably boring before actually doing it. That’s because I’m thinking about it beforehand, I shouldn’t think about things before I do them, I should just do them. Your powers of predicting experience are weak and inaccurate – yet how much we use them for making decisions.
