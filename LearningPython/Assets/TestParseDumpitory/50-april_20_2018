So apart from a single omegle conversation I stayed strict to the thing. I watched a lot of YouTube lectures and went to meals to keep myself busy. Iâ€™m gonna do no carb for a week starting tomorrow, I think I may have the yeast thing forgot the name. After this I need to get and stay healthy. Brown rice, sweet potatos, etc.
