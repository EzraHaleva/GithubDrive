Shabbat was mostly a success. Was tired during the reading at the end, and didn’t finish all of it, but occupied most of my time with productive things, pushing through fatigue. It is also good I read what I wrote yesterday. Those words are clarity. Man the fuck up is correct. Now that I’ve done it my entire countenance had changed. I’m focused, my head is in the game. The shit I'm studying now is so fucking difficult, life is easy. This is a good thing. The one violation was that I ate watermelon to my content. It doesn’t matter how much you eat, it should never be to the point where an additional piece won’t taste good.
