As we relaxed off our gym and diet routine for the sake of getting better, so too did we lose all discipline and strength with which to tackle life. I spent all of yesterday on videogames or youtube videos, I did zero work. From the great highs of debauchery seemingly always fall spectacular lows of inefficiency and incapability. Our debaucherous nighttime activities must, like all other things, be disciplined. We’ll limit our alcohol intake to some set amount, we’ll go home at a set time, and all will be well. 

	That settled, we also have the task of getting ourselves back together, of becoming strong through adopting strength. Of course, any such wisdom I’m saying now is only the previously realized knowledge. I’m not contributing anything new at the moment. Perhaps I’ll stop for today, maybe tomorrow I’ll have more to say. I should create some plan of action for getting my shit together though – work on soft meth project, eat breakfast, clean room. Sounds like a plan.
