Last night was definitely something horrendous. I suppose we shouldn’t relegate the failure or catastrophe or accident or whatever one may call it to only last night, though. I’m hoping it’s a result of some deeper issue that perhaps we can fix, that it’s not just as simple as “I’m tired, I don’t want to work right now”. I suspect it may have something to do with our sexual deviancy and debauchery, specifically fucking Rodna – that was a disgusting mistake. 

	In any event, my life has largely gone to shit – especially espoused by my recent inability to do the work I know I need to be doing, abdicating those fundamental responsibilities to life. I’m very tired and fatigued right now, and this frightens me that I won’t have the energy to take care of what I know I need to do, being the remainder of my software meth project. That, being our current primary source of stress, must be addressed with a top priority. Perhaps we’ll do that now and return to the journal once it is all done.

I finished project, had some nicotine and coffee and dicked around for a while. I feel much better though, relaxed, though likely not masculine. Mind is still blank, but let us plan out at least a small plan of things to do for today. 

Finish comparch project, submit software meth with bobby
