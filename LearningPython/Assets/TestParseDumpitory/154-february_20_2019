In this new Journal, there won’t be ramblings of my emotional diarrhea, but valuable ideas. If you wouldn’t send shit to a friend, you shouldn’t send shit to yourself. 



As a result of the dopamine fast (which is also a regular fast) I slept a lot more and feel much better. I’m much more free than I was, though I don’t yet feel fully in control. We should be absolutely free to pursue what we want.

My mind seems open to suggestion and emotion.
