So I fapped and feel no difference, aside from the slight stomach ache. This tells me the super powers we’re very likely not even present, suppressed by my other ailments. Computer, food a big one, and really a lack of utilizing the mind. I just feel uncomfortable all the time, the heat, my head, everything. I need to learn to become at peace with my environment again. Meditation is key, and reading. So rules will be must pray, meditate, and read every day. Then programming will come naturally. Also must journal daily, the analysis really gives me insight. No, don’t say it’s important to have your own room. But, at the same time, I can’t have people reading my journal lest they take it out of context. Should I write it at empty times, and close it when people walk in, being adamant about not one reading it? Idk, but I can’t give in to anything. Yea, I don’t think there’s a way around it, a private or semi private room is necessary. Don’t raise kids unless you have a room for each.
