Today started out ok, not great. I woke up far too late, then got to work but only on navigating windows vim and windows context menus. I still haven’t even gotten windows vim to work properly, only gvim. 

I was very very close to fapping. I watched youtube and crap again. This is not how we want to exist. Don’t take for granted experience of life and progress we’ve had recently. Don’t take for granted how quickly and peacefully the days have gone by, where before each day was agony. Day after day of headache, stagnation, decay. Rejection from women. Prostration to men. The deepest and most profound emotions I’ve ever felt, only being the direct result of my own shit status, of my own absolute and petty mediocrity. I can’t let this continue. 

As much as I now want to go to sleep, I know I need prove myself. Going to the gym right now is truly the last thing I want to do. Perhaps it’s physically even suboptimal. But, change in action never comes without change in mind. Going to the gym right now, slow burn or normal, however I do it, it’s a big fat fuck you to the mediocrity. It’s a big fat fuck you to descending into the warm cozy life I would so normally just descend back into as I go to school, then face the horrors and anxieties of stagnation and lack of ability. FUCK THAT. Fuck it. I’ve lived virtually my whole fucking life this way and we know how shit it is. How can we not? 

What are the practical steps then? First, see if we can get command line vim working so we don’t have to deal with that crap in the morning. Then Gym, then sleep. 4:30 tomorrow we’re going for a run dick face.
