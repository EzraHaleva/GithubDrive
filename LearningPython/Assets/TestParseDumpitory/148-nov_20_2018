Failure here, failure there, failure really everywhere. Up, down, all around. I hate it. I hate that k watch movies. I hate that I’m addicted to YouTube. I hate that I am dependent on these immediate gratifications, that I can be conversation with someone and my energy is dead, that it suddenly is a burden for me to talk to them. I hate the headaches, I hate the impact it has on my psyche, j hate how it requires my brain to crave and respond to and seek out this shit, how my brain has interpreted reality from the standpoint of it’s necessity. Why can I just not want to waste time, why can I just never get tired of working. Well, hang on a tick, physically I think it should be possible. Now, our Lin alg midterm may be a failure, this is unavoidable. Further, being 20% of our grade a failure can be really bad. So, it’s very possible because of our incompetence we'll only get a b+. If that happens, so be it. We weren’t ready. The failure is then perfect. If it is a result of my behavior it is the reality that is a perfect remedy to my crippled soul.
