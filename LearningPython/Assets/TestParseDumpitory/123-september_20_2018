Was on the true verge of relapse last night. I don’t know what to do, but I cannot do immediate gratification on YouTube anymore. I require intimacy, perhaps, but reserve that intimacy for God. This is the solution. Well don’t say marry yourself to God cuz that’s gay but nohomo love god. Confide in him, our father. He will protect us, but cease disappointing him. It is only when we live under him that he is there for us.
