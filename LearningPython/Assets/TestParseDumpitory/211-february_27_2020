The intensity of that sadness seems to have dissipated, but I’m still of mind enough to challenge myself. That stagnation, as I’ve probably already discovered in the past, is I think a product of giving into to fear, of not pushing against resistance. Because, of course, resistance is essential for growth. One unable to push against resistance is wholly unable to grow. I feel an eagerness to work, but not as much for horizontal society so maybe for the sake of that eagerness we’ll forgo it for today.
