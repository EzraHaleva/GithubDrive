12:32 next day

I’ve gone to sleep quite late tonight, though I woke up later so it works out. I felt a bit sick but was able to overcome it and workout. I definitely wasted time today, meandering and waiting. Also I’m feeling the super powers a bit but not a lot. I think I’m maybe starting to flatline. Urges have been, for the most part, under control. Im somewhat confident I can avoid wet dreams. I don’t want to lose super powers, it truly is a consequence of not living in reality. I must acknowledge my reality is I will not experience sexual pleasure for a very long time, perhaps not even a year. I don’t need to find a girlfriend, but I do need to be successful and perhaps I may meet a person whom I can spend  lot of time with. If not, I’ll focus on programming and success, the yooj. If the time comes that I’m older and still a virgin I’ll ask Dad, see what he thinks. I should be ok so long as I don’t obsess over it. If I can become content with no sex it shouldn’t skew my sexual desires. Really I have none right now, I fathom that sex would be pleasurable but no type of girl is so especially appealing.
