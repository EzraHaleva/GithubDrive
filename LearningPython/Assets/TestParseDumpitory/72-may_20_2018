I felt very good this morning, but got incredibly tired during ulpan. I mean, I usually do, but I suppose I survived reasonably . Iâ€™m also very hungry right now, am going to gym to work off the hunger. I should be able to finish my list today. 

12:30 am

Finished the list except for faur after poker, which was dumb to think I could do anyway. In poker though I became a child after winning and lost in the end. I was playing well in the beginning though, I think. I notice my mind healing, it feels good. I still lack the super powers I once had though. It will take time and more healing to build them back. Hopefully soon.
