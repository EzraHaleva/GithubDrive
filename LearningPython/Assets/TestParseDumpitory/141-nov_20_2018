12:43 the next day

One thing I noticed in my past journals is I always take it as an oppurtunity to declare “here and now” that I’ll finally shape up, and finally become a person I’m not ashamed to be. My natural response is that I’m not accepting my state and I think it’s right. Instead of always feeling bad about what happened and proclaiming “I’ll finally change, this time I’ll see the light”, it would be better to accept what I’ve done, accept that I am the aggregate of my actions, and try to have the best future. Who I am is not a matter of conscious choice, it is a dependant result on the conscious choice of action. Who I am right now is someone who watches meme videos and anime all day, who doesn’t interact with people very much and drinks gatorade because he is addicted and attached to pleasure. That is who I am, and that is fine. Tomorrow I will be a new person, yet one with a physical inclination to such behaviors. Whether the brave soul will handle it in stride and study for the Buddhism exam or sloth further and watch meme videos or read the laws of power or the next rational male book all day, that choice is up to him. Again, I feel like I’m trying to change through proclamation in this journal. Alright, well then lets change the format. Instead of a rambling essay of thoughts, we’ll have two main essays or likely paragraphs. First, it will be an analysis of yesterday’s journal and theory. We will have a theory document in which we write down the theory as we come up with it. Today, for instance, we’ll talk about identity being an aggregate of behavior. The second paragraph will be a practical analysis of our behavior, or identity for that day. What we did wrong, what we could’ve done better. It hurts just to even think about it, so I will indulge and save that for tomorrow when we don’t have to address such a massive failure complicated by shabbat.
