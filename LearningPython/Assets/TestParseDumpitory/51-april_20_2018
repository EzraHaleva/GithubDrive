So I went on Reddit again for some 5 hours last night. I really should have kept to my principles with ades. It’s grest to go out with him, but I can still eat healthy. Regardless, u behaved as if I will be carb free for a week so now I must stick to the plan I’ve laid out. Cook all your own food. It’s not worth it. Everything is more connected than I explicitly realized. The health, the mind, the body, success, relationships, the soul, everything is connected. What is bad for one is bad for all, what is good for one is good for all. It is then so imperative to pursue the correct path in all facets of life. So, for school, we really need to start working on the projects. Procrastination brings stress and poison to the body. 

12:38 next day

So I spent the majority of the day cooking and hackying with libgdx, also did some reddit. Didn’t do other stuff, was too tired I guess. Tomorrow I’ll have a lot of work to do, may end up napping.
