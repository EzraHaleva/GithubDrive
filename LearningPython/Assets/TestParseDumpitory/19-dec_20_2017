Rule 1, No distractions: 

Failure 1) This morning I spent a little more than an hour reading about net neutrality. My justification was that I was becoming informed, that it was research, not a waste of time. In reality though this knowledge has no worthwhile practical impact on my life nor does it get me anywhere closer to my long-term goals. 

Solution - before doing anything questionable, especially on the internet or in a groggy, not 100% state, question and prove to yourself if that action will benefit you in light of your long-term goals. If yes, you may proceed. Otherwise, no. 

Failure 2) More innocent this, spent collectively an hour searching online for injury’s. I’m going to see a doctor if it doesn’t improve, ultimately this research was useless.

Solution- don’t research injuries. “research” of WebMD bull shit is no longer exempt from the tech distractions category. 

Rule 2, Health:

Completed

Rule 3, productivity

 I didn’t finish Hebrew homework within the 3-hour timeframe and then didn’t have time to do an important thing. There was a lot of mundane things to be done today – cooking, gym, gym recovery – that wasted a lot of time. Programming was completed, but I wasted a lot of time fiddling with the themes. 

Solution – If you sense yourself wasting time, stop. Find an immediate solution to the largely unimportant issue and continue. Also, try rushing through the gym procedure next time. Waiting for the perfect moment for everything takes too long. 

Conclusion

Rule 1 – wasted time today, but is somewhat innocent.

Rule 2 – Except for shoulder injury, no issues

Rule 3 – need to be more time efficient, otherwise good job. I struggled through Hebrew.
