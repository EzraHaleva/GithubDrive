I’ve seemingly calmed down from Rutgers. No need to think on it further. As for my productivity, it wasn’t great yesterday because of the tekes, but I must be fully productive today. I don’t see myself going to the gym today, but if I can get some Hebrew and programming progress done I’ll be happy. If not, I really need to start addressing where my time is going. I chill with Richard every morning, perhaps I should just close my door and start working idk. Maybe I should work before the shower. Definitely need to enforce rule, when I am awake and look at my phone for the time, I go in for a shower. It doesn’t have to be cold, but I should end cold.
