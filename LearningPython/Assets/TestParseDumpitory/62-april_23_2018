I’m feeling better, I feel good when I eat, am very tired after eating the big meal though. Could be just because I need sleep. I hope I can get some coding done during kabbalah. After watching the movie with Woody Allen and the such, I’m feeling a tad existential. As if I’m at some point in my life where it’s near the end, like we’re getting ready to move out. Since, when major things happen you consider everything in a major scale and thus the remainder of life is not even fathomed as you think of life as one step or a series of steps in a larger picture, with undue focus on the other parts.

I felt emotionally insecure after getting my 86 grade back. As if it hurt my intelligence. My mind is totally not in sync with reality when it comes to grades. I must be careful with grades and be prepared for the possibility of failure. I could have failed my philosophy paper too, and if I have I am no different than before. I choose to do real work over trying hard to get a grade, so the grade is only important insofar as it is an accurate assessment of real knowledge, which it is clearly not.
