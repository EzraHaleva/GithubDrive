I feel the water fast really helped me set my goals straight and be conscious of what I'm eating. I also had what I believe to be a productive conversation with Noam, hopefully my insights can help him improve his life. I don't feel like writing right now, Richard believes in kabbalah suddenly and I would rather like to dissuade him of this nonsense.
