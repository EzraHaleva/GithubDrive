Aaand failure. What I experienced yesterday was a pure sort of focused state, but I readily shifted back to the attached self. It was sort of like the edge of death, like the present doesn’t matter because a great journey is ahead. I wouldn’t pursue what was yesterday, I’ll just continue as I am. Also, fast is going exceedingly well, but in building this potential for food I must be careful not to spend it. Frivolously and be bankrupt once more. You should be rich with all the things you could eat, yet never spend your riches in order to maintain security.  Tomorrow is Mono diet time. We will live off Shredded wheat with milk and tea.

Well, today has been a success. I held frame for the most part, whenever I used the internet I asked myself “What is it I’m using the internet for”. Day 2 is a long time coming, lets not fuck it up. Tomorrow will be monodiet except meat on Shabbat. After Sammy communicated through Rebecca that he has issue with my interaction with the chabad girls, I’ve resigned to not interact with them. Sammy was mad and his anger was making me mad and disturbing me. I told him I won’t interact with him until he relieves the tension, which I am always open to do. This was a good diagnosis. Now, back to monk mode and the such, I didn’t study much today, nor did I go to class in the morning, nor did I work out, but all is well. This day 1 is a precursor because we fasted. Tomorrow we’ll also start our precursor week with the monodiet. We’ll be allowed lean meat (grilled chicken, burgers, steak)
