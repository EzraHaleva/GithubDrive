I was sick and fatigued for most of the holiday, and they were speaking Hebrew so I never chimed in. The correct thing to do would be to run the conversation with English, but do I have such authority in a house where I’m a guest? The whole guest dynamic seems a bit shit to me. Too much politics and too much, “what can I do for you m'lord”. Should guests only be people you already know? Or should there be a way of getting to know the guest properly after their invitation? Additionally, I think if one is hosting, the topic of conversation should be something all members can participate in. This requires contentful discussion probably, and thus people who seek and discuss content. What is conversation? There are the initial confirms to convention to situate the relationship, but once that exists what do you discuss? It is probably based off of good principles, like getting to know a person and then providing the insights and perspective that you can.

I thought to myself when I went out that shomer negia is ridiculous, but didn’t I think no sex outside of a relationship was ridiculous too. My life will not improve by getting with gs. My identity and my value come from my accomplishment, not my ability to get girls. Getting girls is worthless. No more. No more girls dominating my life. No more wet dreams. I’ll touch girls for hand shaking, greeting hugs, but that’s it. No romantic anything with girls. No relationships until I find a girl I would marry. Girlfriend means nothing.
