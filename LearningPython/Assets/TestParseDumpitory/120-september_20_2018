So I missed my bhuddism class and fell into a depression. I then watched a Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris debate. I feel sad and then lost in the world, and this leads me to question everything. Should I “hold on” and wait for my emotions to return to a normal state. If my fundamental rules for the good life fall into question, then the good life must have something to do with my predisposition. Perhaps it is a result of health, perhaps it is a necessity of love. I don’t actually think that’s it. It’s true, I feel like crying, so perhaps live seems like an outlet for that anima. I want to hold tight to something I enjoy, knowing at least I have that. But is this right? At this time, we know it is actually feasible that not hookups but relationships are good.
