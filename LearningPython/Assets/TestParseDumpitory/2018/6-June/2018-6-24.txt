day 1: 

10:16 pm

Today was a moderate success. I abstained from crap, but was almost wholly unproductive. I maybe spent 15 minutes writing code, absolutely nothing remotely substantial. I need a whiteboard and I need to plan. Coding is a struggle because I know I'm always lost and struggling, but it is precisely this struggle that makes me a better coder. Toil, work hard, and you will be amazed at your progress. New rule, must code for 1 hour every day.
