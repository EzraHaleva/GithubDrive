day 6: 

8:53 am

So last night I had a dream that Lucy was here. In this dream I loved her, I felt the emotion, and we interacted as if in the pre stages of a relationship (flirty, playful, etc.). The dream ended this way and then I woke up, reminded of Rose and the similar event I remember those years ago. Then I, feeling love for her, looked at past pictures of her and saw her promiscuousness, her whoring really, and almost entirely fell out of love. It's imprint is still there, but my love for God has resumed itself at the highest point of my belief. This makes me immensely glad. The idea of fapping is completely repulsive to me, I feel in the presence of God.
