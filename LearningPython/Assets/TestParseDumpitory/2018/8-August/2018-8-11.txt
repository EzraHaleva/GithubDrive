day 2: 

11:37pm

So even though I ate crap on Shabbat and watched some more Lenovo reviews, I still think I performed well over Shabbat, though I should work on belonging with my family I guess more than what I'm otherwise doing. I'm not necessarily their friend or counselor, but their family (at least regarding mizrahi children). I also came dangerously close to relapse but also saw the new benefits of my streak. I was fucking on today at Paullete's and it was great. Also with dogie I was ok. I was cringey with Jaime on the bike though, speeding to get validation if some kind. Overall I'm happy with how Shabbat went and look forward to next week. I do need to plan my day though I still have a level of anxiety over unfinished projects etc. Also need to email people asap for my dining at RU.
