day 1: 

12:20 pm

It seems fitting to call this Monk mode 7: Maturity (7 is just the next one in line). I even reformed my goals to an extent. No longer do I desire success, I desire to be my best and to work at my most efficient level, to be as close to god as I can or rather to serve him as effectively as I'm able over my lifetime.

Well I shoofed Reddit while waiting and it wasn't a good idea. My head hurts now, I feel fatigued not invigorated. Tonight I'll find something to do when I have free time.
