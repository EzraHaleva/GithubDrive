SAoNGaF prompted me tt question why I'm sad that I wasn't so popular today, especially at the end. And it really all comes back to a girlfriend. We are done with this. I'm hesitant to restrict myself from having a girlfriend because it seems it would be beneficial, but I would never marry this woman anyway. It does not matter. No girlfriend – done. But maybe I don't even desire a girlfriend, maybe I even desire just being playful with a female. No being playful with females then? Yes. That's a move. Just as I'm not playful with men, I shan't be playful with women – at least for a month. I must stop desiring anything, and start being content with what I have.
