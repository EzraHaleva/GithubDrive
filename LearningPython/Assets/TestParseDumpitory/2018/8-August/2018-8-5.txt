3:41 next day

Woah buddy this is a late one. I'nve noticed I always feel tired before I go to write the journal but that once I do I feel a lot better and happy I'm writing it. Tomorrow morning we have to plan a system. Steak and eggs diet also, 100% because we are getting very very fat. If we lethargically starve it's ok, we can always rest or meditate or read a book, perhaps even go walking. We also need to create a system. This is why a room is so vital for productivity, or at the least a whiteboard that I don't mind sharing. If I were to write my shit on the whiteboard in the basement I'd advertise my inner most thoughts to the whole fucking house. Ultimately, maybe I should be comfortable with this, idk. At the very least my kids will have their own room. A schedule is something I can write down though, it's just the constitution I really have to hide. A primary goal must be to recreate the translation and to harass dad to make the recording. It's a fucking disgrace, I have no capacity for prayer. Or perhaps I do but I'm a pussy, halas. Also, even if I'm tired on keto, my productivity will never be optimal until I've been clean for at least a month. I need to accept that and take the 40% instead of the unrealistic 80%, which really results in maybe 3% efficiency. For example, what did I do today? I spent maybe an hour and a half installing whiteoard. 3 hours were spent working, the rest were on garbage. I woke up at something like 10 this morning. That is 16 hours, 5.5 of which were actually spent doing something (when building bookcase is included). My net productivity was about a third, and worse of that third none was spent programming. Fuck dude. I hate work. Don't hate it though, don't make it another source of blame. Be glad you have the opportunity to work rather.
