12:53 next day

You are not special chapter of not giving fuck. Though I didn't think I'd learn much going into it, I now see that my specific chronic problem of addiction to immediate gratification and escape from reality must be commonplace. I'm not the only one with this problem. I'm not the only one who's an unproductive fuck. I'm definitely on the lower end I must think, perhaps my basket was shit in this way, but there are people much lower than I am and there are people at precisely the same level too. The problem must have been solved, but I'm getting ahead of myself because I still haven't resonated that the experience I'm having is being had my many many others if not most others. It's something big and prominent – and no don't become special by beating the problem everyone else has. Become valuable and integrated by achieving the best success possible along with everyone else. Maybe it's grow the fuc up (probably if I'm honest), maybe it's just to be comfortable being uncomfortable. Perhaps I can't feel happy as an adult because I don't enjoy the other pleasures of adulthood – notably personal relationships. It may be unfortunate that I can't integrate like I imagine I ideally would, but maybe it's not unfortunate but average. Maybe growing up is always this hard, regardless I need to grow up with or without friends if I ever hope to enjoy adulthood with friends. Don't do extremes, but you know what you need to do. You need to lose weight and eat less – you need to tell Jared you want to assess your schedule before moving forward with the game, you need to apologise for not being as productive as you'd hoped you'd be – careful not to entice pity. You then need to finish the amida translation because we need to pray meaningfully. We also need to say the shema with tefillin because it is beneficial.
