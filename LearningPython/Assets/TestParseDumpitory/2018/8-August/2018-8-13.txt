day 1: 

7:32 am

In gym parking lot, relapse yesterday on youtube, not importabt. In the carride to the gym just now I was able to rediscover, not a belief in Judaism, but how the path forward is through Judaism. The idea is fleeting, but the god we worship is arbitrary, he outlines a set of behaviors we should do to improve ourselves and these behaviors are the law. At the very based level, we may at some point feel we have no control over our lives, over our inadequacy. At that point I told myself “at least I can control my behavior, keep going to the gym and keep not immediately gratifying”. And then it “hit me” that we are lost truly in what we should do, and this is the necessity of a god, to define what behavior we should have. The behaviors God has laid out for us are how we improve, it's bot about the concept, it's not fairyland abstraction, it is about the behavior in all it's low level glory.
