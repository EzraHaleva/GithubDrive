10:55 pm

I watched avatar with Sammy just a bit ago. My mind immediately felt worse. No more of that. Leave the room or some shit next time. Also, finally settled on a Thinkpad which is nice. Otherwise I was very unproductive today but not indulging in crap. If we break down my day, I woke up late, went to gym, then went to work, then gazzed for far too long, investigated some videos maybe? I'm not sure, I don't actually remember at this point. Then it became 6 ish and I went to pick up Rosa and do butcher. After that I went to Dean's, ate cream, and did a good amount of nothing. I chatted with Jared and then shoofed laptops, before ultimately and lethargically showering and retiring to bed, where we watched avatar. Be more productive tomorrow.
