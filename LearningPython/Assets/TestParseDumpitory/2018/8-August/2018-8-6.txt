9:07 pm

So today was definitely more successful than yesterday or my usual days. The improvement wasn't massive but was good. I feel at peace. As I continue to heal I hope I'll become more productive. The job is bothering also because I'm afraid I won't get paid for the lack of catalyst data. Just destress. Even if we don't get paid our situation is still good and optimistic. God has given you many gifts, there is no need to be upset if he takes from us in addition to giving.
