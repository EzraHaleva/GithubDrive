day 0: 

9:44 am

I still call this day 0, why? Well I've set to release myself from technological immediate gratification. I am still trapped. Break free, brother! Let go, there is happiness beyond immediate gratification – a happiness ferociously burning, an inferno of life. No more Reddit for a week. No YouTube ABSOLUTELY. No movies, no computer, nothing. Turn it off and don't turn it back on. Texting because I need friendships – desperately. I need to enjoy them – desperately. I need to enjoy work – desperately.
