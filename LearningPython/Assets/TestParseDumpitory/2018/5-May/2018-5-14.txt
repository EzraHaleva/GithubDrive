Day 1: 

So I went out with Ben tonight and the lack of superpowers was disgustingly obvious. Nofap is more important than anything. I definitely have urges like Friday, no matter what I can't give in â€“ even if I were to become permanently debilitated. The diet was successful though, I'm very pleased with how I feel on carnivore. Hopefully I'll have more to say later on, I feel fatigued and headache now, probably because no exercise and dehydrated.
