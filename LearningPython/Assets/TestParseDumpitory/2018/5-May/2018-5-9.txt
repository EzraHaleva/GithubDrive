I relapse last night with YouTube only, but right now I'm feeling pretty good. I think the lasting effects of an immediate gratification binge are definitely less than a food or fap binge for sure. I think it's in the fact that I'm engaging with a community, even in a false skewed sense. An idea that makes a lot of sense now immediately comes to mind, friends give you the emotional energy necessary for productivity. New rule, do something with friends every single day. People you can enjoy. I really think I've found the common cause of relapse, loneliness. But it just can't be hanging with friends, it has to be people your comfortable with. And then we can only develop this through nofap. That's the in, it's the key. Starting with shit life, the first step is noFap with as much productivity as you can muster. Step two is increase your friend pool by a lot. Make friends with everyone, get to know people and consider that we're all very similar. This should lead me to a genuine neutral position. 

I will now describe this ideological position to set it in stone, so I don't forget it and know to embody it. My natural inclination is pragmatic libertarian, but I consciously decided not to judge people based on political views and then also not to take my political views so seriously, and certainly not as facts to use in concluding other things. I decided this because I figure that most other people would decide the same thing as me in my situation. That's not to say everyone is right in their own way, or this sort perrenial thing, but I think certain situations are more conducive to a true conclusion than others.
