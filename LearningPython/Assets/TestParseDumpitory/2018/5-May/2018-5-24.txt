day 2: 

7:13 am

Dream time boys. Me and some friends had found an old game that was broken, we fixed it up with someone putting more effort than everyone else into fixing it, and we played it. It was 2d, almost looked like MegaMan. You would jump around and shoot each other with a volley of machine gun bullets. You had to jump far though and the map would start falling. Interesting.

10:00 pm

Waiting at bus stop to go out with ades. Today I felt ok, did work but also did a lot of sleeping and read Robinson Crusoe for a long time. Perhaps I should limit this as well on weekdays. I felt a little insecure as if I was avoiding work, but I should know in truth what I am doing, and need only look within myself for the answer. I definitely felt I needed a fresh perspective, at least regarding my presentation. We'll see, don't stress about the quality I think. A passing grade is an A+. It is also notable that I was very tired, then had butter with Cacao, then felt energized. I'm gonna make literal Cacao butter a staple food. Overall, I feel content but the anxiety of these final projects is definitely there. I should do them perhaps months in advance for the future, so as not to disturb my tranquility in the slightest.
