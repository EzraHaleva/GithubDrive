day 2: 



Today I walked through the old city for some 3 hours 45 minutes. During this time, I found it incredibly difficult not to have songs playing in my head. I also found that I had troubling really absorbing the surroundings as I wanted to. Later I was doubtful of the singing prohibition and sang for 2 minutes roughly. I immediately got a headache, this tells me music, even self created, is immediate gratification and, for my specific case, must be eliminated for the time being. I also feel a bit dead and tired, perhaps I am healing. We shall see, 2 days isn't enough for positive change. In a week I should probably start to feel better.
