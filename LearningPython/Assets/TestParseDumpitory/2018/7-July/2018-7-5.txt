day 1: 

2:52 next day

I wasn't gonna journal today, but couldn't really sleep so decided to. As far as the log goes I was semi productive today with coding and c++ all that jazz though I was eating crap and didn't exercise, or meditate, or practice typing, or read. So I'm for sure missing some big shit here and it's all part of it. You have private time when Sam is at work, use it nigger. Get your books in order, get your whiteboard in order.
