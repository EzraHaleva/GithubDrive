So today I decided to fast because my previous failures, really sins, have been troubling to my psyche. Well, it is more really because I have been unable to change my habits and I hope this will give me some emotional easiness to change. But, it isnt the affliction but the behavior that changes you, but the affliction must play some role psychologically that makes the behavior easier, right? Perhaps the behavior has a set difficulty level of psychological strain, no matter what you do it'll be just as hard. This goes well with the nothing is changing idea, that every failure I have is truly the same.

I think I must now approach this with a scientific method of sorts. That is, to approach this like a research. Document how I'm feeling, when I feel an inclination to deviate from my ideal path, and what I need to address. Perhaps in the notes we will start some journal, or perhaps we'll make a physical copy. Right now for example, I want to stop writing. Why? I feel tired perhaps, there is a tension in my head, I am uncomfortable, it's too hot, my pinky is discomforted from an awkward position
