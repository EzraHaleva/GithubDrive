day 2: 

1:31 pm

How quickly we are susceptible to insanity. I've lost frame, and I can't seem to retain it. The only way I was able to save myself was from 1- my admission to kurt that he can have the icecream, so that if I eat it there is shame, and 2 â€“ classical music. Even now, I'm on a steady mental IV drip of classical reading music just to prevent myself from relapse. This journal is also serving that very purpose. I believe it was the food. I didn't need to eat, I chose to eat. Never choose to eat, be forced to eat. There are always options, don't fret for timing, with anything, ever. Pursue food when hungry, and be late. The body can compensate, a missed meal here, and extra there. It should work and lets try this strategy. Only puruse food when you feel a need.
