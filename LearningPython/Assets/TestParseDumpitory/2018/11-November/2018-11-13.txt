day 0; 

10:58 pm

Really didn't want to do this journal right now and that's precisely why I've done it. I've lost my 83 day streak and fapped, once twice and three times. Today is day 0 and if we keep it our streak will be consistent for both monkmode and nofap, which is convenient. So don't fuck this one up. Very high energy from the caffeine, just took 111 midterm2. Anyway, so what went wrong was a loss of frame, of realization, of the positive benefits of monk mode. The prize escaped me. It's not good enough for me to consciously recognize it, this position isn't strong enough. I must emotionally feel it's value. An easy way to do this is to befriend many women, of course, and perhaps this is the route I'll take. I should hang out with women more, be more aggressive and get numbers, hang out, everything. Female friends can be your salvation, but of course not alone. If you use them to escape doing work you will fail. Work must still be the number 1 priority. Study up that linear algebra tonight, since you won't be asleep for any time soon. Lets get fucking cracking nigga. Monk Mode whatever begins.
