day 1: 

11:26

Got into Rutgers! My life won't have that struggle and hardship, this must be a platform to ascend to greatness. Speaking of ascension to greatness, I felt rather unproductive today. Going over what I did, I translated prayers, worked out my biceps and triceps, cooked and ate food, and worked on editing, finishing tutorial and just need to work on introduction. If we break down by expected time, translation is prob an hour, biceps triceps another hour, cooking and eating should be around 2.5 for today, and editing would be an hour. That's 5.5 hours yet I woke up at 11 and it's twelve hours later. I need to rush through the unimportant things. It's nice to take life easy and be relaxed, but we can still be tranquil when rushing. Maximize your time, it is valuable.
