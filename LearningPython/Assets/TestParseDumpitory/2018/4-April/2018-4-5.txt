Day 1, 

10:00 (approx)

Wet dream. I know exactly how it happened to. I was in the party, and the girl was grinding and twerking. I went up to the hottest of the uglies and grinded on her for 5 seconds, then came. Then, as if to save me, the girl I knew through chabruta suddenly asked and became my girlfriend, a completely religious girl. We did a sort of cuddle thing in the dream and nothing more. No more clubbing, or rather, aspirations of clubbing. Is a good story all that worth it? Do we really bond drunk out of our minds? Perhaps it increases status to get girls, so I might pursue it, but success I assure you will increase status more than anything. No more clubbing. My values are such that I don't wish to have any sexual interaction with girls, so I must act out this behavior. For all the times I wanted to go clubbing, I will not go not once, unless you count that disaster with Lucy. When I get to college, perhaps I'll go to sophomore dorms. I need real girls if I want them, not whores and sluts. If I see girls dancing, I will leave. No Jeff parties no nothing. Boys nights out, sure, if a girl becomes involved I no longer will be, end of story. I'm done with this shit.

Today at the gym I felt really good, was talking to people, met Nazer, looked good. Even though I relapsed, I still have super powers. It's important I make friends though. Being alone â€“ just can't do it. There's not enough to find within yourself, or maybe there is.
