day 2: 

11:53

I drank carrot juice, had mayo at Burger market today. I felt like crap after, had bad gas at the gym. It could also be the chocolate though. Tomorrow Im cutting out chocolate, mayo, and carrot juice. Productivity wise I was ok. Was befriending Kayla in hopes of connection to my girls, which isn't bad I guess.
