1:00 the next day

This is the real relapse. I fapped. The counter is reset. I must absolutely fill my life with content, with productivity. If it is hard I will struggle. If I feel like crap I will still do, even at the production of a bad product. I will keep producing no matter what. In sickness or in health, in hunger or in satisfaction, in exhaustion or with energy. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. What I've lost needs to be mourned. I can build it back, I will build it back. I will be productive. I will pray. I will no longer be a slave its done. It's done. It's done. Monk mode 4 starts this Sunday. God help me. We are in survival mode. This is our life. To not do this crap is to live. After Shabbat ends we are done.
