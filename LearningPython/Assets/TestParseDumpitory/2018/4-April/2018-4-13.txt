day 1: 

Though I'm still incredibly nervous about rutgers, and this is a point of stress in my life, the future looks bright. I felt incredible today. The combined benefits of going out with people and not drinking are fantastic. I must do more of this. Tell Aviv every thur, work every Friday. Also, the benefits of a proper diet with weight loss further contribute to this enhanced mood. When in tune with reality, you must craft for yourself a good reality. Then you will have reality based emotions which are the most potent and real. If the reality is good, your good emotions will be incredible. If it is bad, the bad emotions will push you towards the good. Even if I don't get into Rutgers, I still have options. Don't think permanently about an unknown. arrogance is harmful for others, but most importantly it is harmful to the self. I can still be successful, not on a long shot but in Reality, regardless of whether I get into Rutgers. If I don't, I'll need to work hard to create a new plan, but I am ready and prepared to do this necessary work. God has equipped me with the tools, I need simply use them. I am 100% capable. The Tora will never be outside your grasp.
