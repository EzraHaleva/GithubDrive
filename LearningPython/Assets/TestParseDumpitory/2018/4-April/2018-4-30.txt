day 3: 

10:58 pm

I woke up at 6 today and it is 11pm now. That is 17 hours. I had class from 8:30 to 12, then again from 3:30 to 8. That is 8 hours. What did I do with the 9? I showered, prayed, translated, went to gym, cooked and ate food, talked briefly with udren, cooked and ate food, then fucked off texting. I need to be more energetic, especially with the cooking. I need to save time.
