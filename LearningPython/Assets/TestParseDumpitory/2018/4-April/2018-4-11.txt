day 3: 

7:48

I'm feeling white hungry and tired in resent, hopefully as a result of the diet and the candida going away. I've also been less productive. My genius feels depleted I think. I feel an anxiety as if I can't be productive at all, it's been quite saddening. Perhaps it's because I've been focusing on YouTube and not making the actual game. I do think the skills I'll gain becoming a YouTuber will benefit me in life though. Presenting yourself before a camera can help you present yourself to a public, hopefully. I then need to try to compile some values, use my analytic skills to determine ideal concepts. Idk. I fear I won't be able to do this analysis. I probably only need one YouTube video. The rendering part is the bit we need to understand.
