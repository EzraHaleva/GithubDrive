day 1: 

Bollocks to lot of work to do lol. I wasted too much time watching the nice Australian doctors YouTube videos and recognized I need to stop. Also, someone showed me how to clear the screen in libgdx from stack overflow, which worked out well. I also feel like I'm back. When I was doing the prayers today, the only thing I really had time to do, I felt that same productive feeling as before. Tomorrow I should really try to make a rough script and eclipse doc for the tutorial. So not in the mood for neuro ec, too much stuff to do. I also think the sort of weening iff reddit where I can respond to responses but can't make new comments us good. But I really need to stick to no lurking and no new comments.
