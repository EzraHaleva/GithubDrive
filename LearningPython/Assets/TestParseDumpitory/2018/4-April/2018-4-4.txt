Day 4, 

So today I relapsed. No, I didn't fap lol I'm not that weak, but I did go on Reddit for probably an hour. This shows me, I can't even abstain for a week. This is just like nofap. I need to break it. If I am alone I am alone. If I am tired I must sleep. If I sit and do nothing I shall sit and do nothing.
