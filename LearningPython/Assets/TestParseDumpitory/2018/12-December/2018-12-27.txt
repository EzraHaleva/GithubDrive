2:13 next day

Deep, debilitating relapse. A fatigue only known to those at rock bottom. Everything has been prepared. Tomorrow I must begin anew, but I don't face tomorrow empty handed. I am armed with knowledge and wisdom. 

1- You must study things, and they must be hard. We will do very difficult CP problems tomorrow, no need for baby shit. 

2- The conditions for happiness are not of this world. They are respective to a moment, and within the realm of your soul. To be truly happy for a moment, one must seek to see the truth. Then they will be happy. 

What can I say that would be unique? I've had this very journal entry many many times. What do I do? I psych myself up? I proclaim, desperately holding on to a mindset I am scared shitless I will lose, that this time I'll be different, that this time I'll change. It never happens though. Why doesn't matter to me. I simply attribute it to my own desires as reflective of my own attachments that I refuse to cede. Cede all attachment. That's it. I'll do that. I'll pray here that God helps me, though I don't even need him to help me especially more than he currently does. I have all the faculties necessary to lose attachment. I need simply do it. That's all. 

Also, as successful as I was in my classes and all that, I shouldn't look on my streak as success that I need to reach. I was still watching YouTube and garbage every other day. That wasn't success at all, it was corruption that avoided fapping purely for symbolic value and not a continued wisdom. If I ever feel myself faltering in wisdom, I should eat something (ensure I'm not tired) and then re align myself with the truths above.
