day 12: 

4:50 (approx, forgot to timestamp)

After shopping at the shook I feel very fatigued. I would reason its because of the hookah. I am now adamant in never doing hookah again. Hopefully I'll heal during the weekend and become productive again. 

7:36

It just occurred to me I've lost my superpowers because of the wet dream. I must now commit to no women. I'll be shomer negja outside of a relationship. Girls need to be out of my life completely as entities with a separate status from men. If I meet a girl and become friendly with her enough that we mutually agreed to start a relationship, I may think of her and only her as the female I consider now. Life is what's important, nothing more.

Albi told me of book bigger leaner, stronger. Will get for Kindle.
