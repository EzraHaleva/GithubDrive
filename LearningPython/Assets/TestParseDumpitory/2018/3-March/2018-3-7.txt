day 2: 

12:41 pm

I'm a tad sick but will completely ignore it, except for non-interruptive remedies. Apart from that I feel alright. I grew very anxious doing my Hebrew homework I think because my surroundings weren't thoroughly organized, too much potential energy. As my confidence grows though this shouldn't become an issue.
