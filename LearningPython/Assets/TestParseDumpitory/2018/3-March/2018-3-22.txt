day 5: 

4:37 pm

So I didn't journal at night last night because was drunk and forgot, but I had Mac and cheese and smoked a lot of hookah. My lungs were rather nigger this morn and when I went to the gym it got worse, but I was alright in the end. I fucked around on Reddit for an hour because was tired then napped for 1.5 I think. In the future I should go to sleep immediately  when tired. Nofap reddit definitely has value, specifically in the Valhalla motivation memes, but this value has diminishing returns. What I'll do is one session at the end of the day, not before bed, for 30 minutes. 

10:49 pm

After programming I basically broke. Was tired again, lost energy. It could be the fact I went to the gym and was tired, but I also did more reddit today that before. Reddit must be the link. I don't need their motivation. I already have my own. What they say will only consume my time at this point. I am done. No more reddit.
