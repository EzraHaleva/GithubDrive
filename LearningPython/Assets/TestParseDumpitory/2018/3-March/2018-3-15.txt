The sides of my throat are now irritated, not the throat but the sides â€“ strange. Two tasks are in order, and I need to/ will do them tonight. First, I need to denote a sick protocol I can follow. Something requiring a treatment/remedy once for every waking hour. Second, I need to compile a nofap motivation list in this journal. Nofap is broken because one has lost awareness of their motivation and superego, awareness of god. This state represents a split in the psyche, it must then be immediately consolidated by reacquainting oneself with this awareness. Thus, I'll put down all the motivations behind nofap, which will restate my goals, reacquainting me with God in the meager capacity in which we're acquainted, while demonstrating the direct connection to nofap. 

 

Sick protocol

-at the change of every hour must perform some remedy to your ailment

-can eat carbs but no candy, limited sugar intake as well

-if mental state is impaired, productivity goals are suspended. 

-no Netflix or aids to existing. 

-must sleep a lot. If tired not allowed to go out nor do anything but sleep.
