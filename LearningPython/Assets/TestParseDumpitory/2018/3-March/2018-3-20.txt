day 3: 

12:36 next day

I feel much better acting more myself, however I did go a bit nishech when talking to Ethan. Again, the middle path is key. I shouldn't be joking to much, but seriously talking of life and things of significance with a jest here and there. The average over an extended time is irrelevant, it must be an average over a very short duration, maybe 5 minutes.  Also, confidence in values â€“ humility in knowledge. Also had a bit of an argument with momzair. I think I need to be more genuine with her with my criticism. I tend to hide what I'm really saying, quite effectively, but it might still show and lead to frustration. It's not like momzair doesn't do that either though, shes far worse than me with that.
