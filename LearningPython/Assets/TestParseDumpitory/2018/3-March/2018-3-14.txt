11:30pm

Im hoping I can start counting days after tomorrow. I didn't do Hebrew homework tonight and I didn't do translation. I was a bit preoccupied with programming though, but now I should be settled into a context where I'm not existentially considering the whole thing, but can simply work and apply in one aspect. I just need to do a once over my class allocation and which classes are accessing/changing what, but I should be ok. Once I start counting days again I'll be in normal routine. 

3:58am next day

Seidel also fucked me tonight. I believe I decided to go because of emotional appeal but also because of allowed flexibility. I think the friend rule should be a limiter, not a minimum. Additionally, I should plan for the late nights in these excursions as well. To maximize my life performance these things need to be planned. No 2 hour relax time after school to do whatever I want, that's bull. Day needs to be planned with objectives in mind and opportunistic allowance determined from a weekly context.
