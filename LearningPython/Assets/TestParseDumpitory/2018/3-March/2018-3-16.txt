I adhered only hecke to sick protocol, and only did programming. I definitely let myself go and I 100% think it was food that did it. Starting Sunday I'll be strict about what I'm eating again and on Sunday I'll start day 1. I'll also allow myself Netflix and the such if I absolutely need it, but if I get an erection at all I have to take a cold shower in order to resume watching. That is the contract.
