10:34 am

So yesterday I relapsed in watching YouTube and the such. Not fun, my social skills went in the toilet. I was ok on my diet, I need to eat more though. Have some sort of snack or two scoops of carb at lunch. 

3:15 pm

I'm walking to my tinder date, decided to write her to relieve some nerves. Why be nervous. If she hates you then your golden, you'll have an exam to study for and do well on. You're a genius buddy, get with it. If there's something you don't know, derrive it like back in highschool. . You're a genius, again, focus on the unconscious, not concsious communication.
