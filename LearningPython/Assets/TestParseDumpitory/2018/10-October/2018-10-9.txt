day 1: 

9:35 am

I say this is day 1 because I downloaded tinder last night and it properly corrupted my mind and day. No more tinder. I'm adding it to the list of Monk mode - not until after a month. Also, if it goes somewhere with Molly limit your interaction with her. Have her come over shabbats for sure. Also was very tired today and didn't wake up at 5:30. This is bad, tomorrow definitely.
