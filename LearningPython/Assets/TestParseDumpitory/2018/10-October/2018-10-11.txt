day 1: 

10:16 a m

I was actually about to go look at Reddit and the such, then I thought it would be more productive to check my journal. I then felt a strong aversion to checking it and figured it is then very important that I do check it. I now feel the aversion is gone and feel more open I suppose. This was progress, I am glad. I was sabotaged today by breakfast. Too Carby. I don't think it's a relapse, but should avoid in future by eating enough during the day prior.
