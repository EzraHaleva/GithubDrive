As I was reading Mastery (one of Robert Greene’s books), he described how we may learn with a certain creative passion and energetic, more capable capacity. That we might learn faster and more readily solidify things in our brain. When looking at the great masters, indeed, what seems to differentiate all of them is that they started working in whatever it is they were great at very early. For Mozart this was very young, and Einstein it was 16. This then filled me with a regret, or perhaps, unhappiness that I wasted so many crucial years not pursuing things with such a vigor and passion. That my capacity for great learning which I sometimes have an inkling of is stifled by my own stupidity and misbehavior. 

The problem here is that this disagrees with our axioms of happiness is always attainable. I wish then to explore this. What if I were to waste the next ten years of my life, the next twenty? What if I am to be inevitably mediocre. What path then do I still have to happiness.

And now whatever it was, that last spark I was endeavoring to write upon, it is entirely lost. Perhaps I can reclaim that idea… No, it’s all gone. At the very least, the negative emotion I sought to eliminate is eliminated, but is this not a result or symptom of my own emotional disconnect due to my abuse of immediate pleasure, internet and fapping and so forth? Once I am more in tune to things, which will take time doing things properly, perhaps this regret will come up again, and philosophy developed to deal with it.
