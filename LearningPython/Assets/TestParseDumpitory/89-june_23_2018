Monk mode 5, the failure, has officially ended and Monk Mode 6 has begun. This chapter is Monk Mode: The Summer to Start a Lifetime. I will not fap, I will not waste time again, for the rest of my life. I proclaim this now because this is my goal and because it is wholly attainable I will simply attain it. As for the science not being settled, I will have an opportunity to change whatever I want one month from now, on July the 23rd. Everything is in place for me, god is with me, and my life begins this moment. In moments of uncertainty I must clarify after thoughtful consideration and stick to my clarification until July 23rd. One clarification, for example, my diet will be strict keto and approximate carnivore. Honey is allowed to make food palatable within the restrictions of keto, but food itself is for fuel. Cold showers every morning too. My mornings will be pray – shower – exercise. I will filll my evenings with productivity. Tomorrow, I must settle into the basement. I must fill the shelves with items essential to my success. I must eliminate my negative impact from this house. 

Fatigue must be met with fire. Resistance and physical ailment met with masochism. Desire met with punishment and laser focus. Do not fantasize. Ever. Ever. Ever. Do not consider the pleasures of fapping, of food, of immediate gratification. These things no longer exist for you. Resonate this truth within, all these things are non-objects within your life. When one mentions it, it is like a tattoo, like a hatred of math, like a following of sports. These things are not you, you are semantics, philosophy, Judaism, self improvement, natural ways of living, humility and awe of the world, and witty good hearted humor that seeks not to alienate but to accept people. Thank God for the beautiful life I’ve been given and thank God for the faculties we all have to enjoy it.
