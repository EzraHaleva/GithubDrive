The fact that my lack of a feeling of satisfaction or fulfillment in my day is due to my lack of use the genius is very clearly apparent to me now, so much so that it seems necessary to make an organized effort to fine fields that utilize the genius (of me). Without this genius my mind feels vanilla, and empty, as if a blank piece of paper. Not clear or transparent, but nothing in a space of nothing. The fulfillment and satisfaction felt when using the genius makes me consider that it may be part of the soul and intelligent human influence, despite it being intuitive and seemingly subconscious in operation. 

I had a glimpse of it last night during the meet and greet, I was discussing and it just appeared. Iâ€™m thinking back to when I would stare out the window and write the videogame ideas on my white board. That was seemingly a controlled and forced application, perhaps something similar, being a distinct goal of knowledge or understanding rather than a simple improvement of knowledge, might trigger it again. Another point is that it seems to emerge when my mind has had an abundance of information to work with. 

-unsurprisingly, it just occurred to me that I experience this activation in talmud class.
