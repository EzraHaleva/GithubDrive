So I’ve yet continued to pursue Skylar, and consciously I do acknowledge it as a problem but I don’t actually believe it. There is an uncertainty. Every time I visualize myself and her hooking up, I look at it as if it will benefit me, but will it really? Perhaps I’ll fool myself of a relationship once more and then fuck myself over. I must stop fantasizing – must stop pursuing. She isn’t real. She is a slut. She will not be your girlfriend – nor is this what you even desire. You desire the high, the pretend of marriage and intimacy that could never exist. Firstly, stop desiring anything period. Don’t desire, simply pursue. Secondly, cease to pursue things that don’t matter. Sex doesn’t matter – I could graduate a virgin and be wildly successful. Why? Because fucking and false intimacy will bring you no happiness – only escape from reality. The reality is we may have passed the test for a fuck buddy, we may be accepted as an empty form of dick and balls, but we have yet to be accepted by the opposite sex in our whole person. We are still a failure, we still need improvement. Our work is far from finished, it has merely just begun. Don’t pursue girls. This sounds horrible, but hear me out. Success in your field will make you more happy than a girl ever could, because you’ll be far closer to true marriage ntham everyone else. .
