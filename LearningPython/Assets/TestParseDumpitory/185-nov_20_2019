Post Shabbat journal check in. I succumbed to simple pleasures again today and binged on food to the extent allowed by my diet. I very seriously considered fapping and felt that same emptiness of addiction. It didn’t feel like there was any way to go on without them, no droll to occupy my mind. At the same time, it definitely made me compulsive again, something I’ll have to struggle to switch back. Relying on people is no good either because you’ll inevitably interact in a beta way, giving more mental grief than it’s worth. Next shabbat lets try making up some task to do to keep busy.
