After shabbat. 

Shabbat was not spent great, not horrible though. I watched a lot of youtube and crap, wasn't super productive coding wise. Also failed in repeatedly acting childish and prostrating myself to family (Ma). I stuck to nofap ok enough. 

What's slightly bothering me is my interview with AT&T. This will need to be addressed better tomorrow. But, in truth, there is nothing to worry about. I need to be upfront about everything, no lies, I took the semester off this past semester because of double pneumonia – out of commission for 3 weeks. If you're honest about it and present it right there should be no problem. That is who you are after all, if they can't take that well tough shit I can't lie. Further, if all things considered they don't want me I won't have them. I'll enforce the frame that I'm excellent for them, and I'm extremely excited to start working – which I am. If they reject that frame so be it. 

Logistically we'll have to make sure our wardrobe is ready, and also study our resume. Bring the 2d game ready on your laptop. 

I think we'll be ready. Envisioning the conversations now, I'm having a good time. Feeling the energy in my heart.
