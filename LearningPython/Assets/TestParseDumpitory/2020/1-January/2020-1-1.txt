This is after the new years party. 

Over the past week I've seen some success productively. I'm not entirely addicted to immediate gratification and sugar, but I haven't been perfect. I've watched a lot of tv, I've eaten crackers, chips, that sort of thing for a while, and I've been ODing on cream and barista drinks. I've grown fat, I've grown boring, I've grown unattractive, and I still feel its sting after the sudden adjustment of my surroundings to what has become of my inner reality. In fairness, that sounds like a load of essentialist whoreshit, but I'm too tired to care to analyze it so deeply. All I know is I need to get skinny, I need to continue to be productive, and I need to read. I need to build myself up and perhaps after that address social things. Really, I'm in dire need of a monk mode. The specifics of how I will address these three goals, fitness (lose weight), productivity (coding), and reading/abstaining from entertainment feeds, these specifics I'll leave out of the journal. One thing for certain is I need to exercise and wake up at a consistent time. 5:30 or earlier is ideal for this now. I need to get on a schedule outside of people.
