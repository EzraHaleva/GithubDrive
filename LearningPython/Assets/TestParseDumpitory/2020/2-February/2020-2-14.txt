8:30 am

Yesterday, perhaps because I woke up late, I ended up very undisciplined. Ended up watching youtube videos again, playing games again, unable to do work. Without discipline we fall apart. A man cannot participate in higher thought without discipline. In this effort we must then be strict and sure. No dopamine things. If we're tired we can sleep or do chores, or some menial software meth stuff. My mind is blank and I'm tired, craving a dopamine fix. Perhaps this craving is why my mind is blank. Let us reject it now.
