Party last night went very well. I was a bit beta with regard to certain pledges, and that must be addressed even if not articulated here, but otherwise had a lot of fun. I lead the interactions with energy and had them go as I wanted them to. It's important not to get sucked into the pleasure, however. The most pleasurable possibility would be to remain both disciplined and fun. To create discipline within the party life itself, that we don't flip from disciplined state to all out emotionality at parties. It shouldn't be something extra-curricular to your routine, it should be incorporated. 

	I'm also noticing I'm not having many insights right now. My mind is just moving, but I don't know or control exactly where. Almost like I've been over-caffeinated. I'm now seeing how this was/is a product of leaving the sphere of my discipline and introspection at the party. Don't let everything go, don't become Dionysus then return to Apollo. Integrate play and work into a single mindset. The priorities should not change, only the specific one being addressed at a specific time.
