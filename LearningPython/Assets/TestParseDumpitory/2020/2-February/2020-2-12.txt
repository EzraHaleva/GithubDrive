Yesterday I wrote two things. One, that we should just read Horizontal Society casually, and that's working well even though we may not absorb every detail. And two, that we should rely on other people for entertainment, and that worked only ok. I'm not so great at getting information and finding things I'm interested out of people, it turns out, so I did a bit of supplicating and seemingly interaction for the sake of interaction. Further, sometimes I was just tired and didn't have the energy to go extract entertainment from someone, or what they could offer couldn't compare to the high dopamine rush of digital entertainment, so perhaps that only means I need time to re-adjust my dopamine. It's then very important I continue to abstain from both technology and fapping for that dopamine readjustment purpose. 

	I also came to a few other conclusions, or rather re-discovered them as they're ideas I've stumbled across before. That is, emotion is a choice, a product of conscious outlook. If we can choose to have positive or negative emotions, choose positive ones – or, rather, the optimal emotional disposition (perhaps one espousing Maimonides middle path or something). Be, perhaps not elated, but content at all times – and never anger unless it suits you (which, it's hard to imagine any scenario in which it does). After looking this up, Maimonides seems to agree anger is never useful and is, in fact, a hindrance to higher understanding which makes perfect sense. 

	The other conclusion I came to, more in line with the social manipulations I was considering and investigating in the summer, is the value of love for people. If someone loves you, for some reason biological or instinctual (or both), you cannot hate them. It even becomes difficult to dislike them. Someone who loves you seems the exact opposite of a threat, if anything you exercise at a minimum pity for them, if not an amount of reverence for you have similar interests in that you both like you. But, this automatic conclusion we make isn't exactly accurate. Someone who loves you is not necessarily totally non threatening, nor totally aligned with your interests. Someone who loves you can be a real threat, and this is where the biological response can be nobly exploited. 

	We could fake love, but why not genuinely espouse it, like the Buddhist? By exercising love towards all people, **but not necessarily respecting them**, everyone will be kind and warm and amicable towards you while you are still acting within your interests. You can stab them in the belly, a warm smile on your face and love in your heart for their being (without attachment, of course), and unless they consciously analyze your behavior and reframe your love in their head as disguised contempt, they will respond as we have described, that is, completely disregarding you as a threat to their interests.

Does this mean we should use love in some psychotic way to exploit people, murdering with love in our hearts? Obviously no, but it does mean we should act self interested **and** love others, especially when **our interests don't line up, or conflict, with their interests**. By loving them you are delighted at what they have created for themselves, at the book of this world God has written them into. Of course, we are still primarily concerned with our own character, but we can be pleasantly amused, delighted, and grateful for the stimulation of others (as a ketab) along the way amidst the plethora of interpretations available from which to view them (mikhtab).

	That's all for today I think. A good journal, I'm happy.
