Possibly related to our breaking of nofap, we've been in a total shit streak. Last nights party was certifiably comparable to new years. Whatever mojo may have existed is, once again, lost. This idiocy of up and down, alpha and beta, has to totally stop. I can't handle this shit. The answer is very simple – become unattached to women. It's been staring us in the face all along, the implementation is just understandably daunting. All of my success is based on shaky emotional circumstance. When I feel good I act good, when I feel bad I act bad. The only consistency in your life you can control is your career, your mission. That must be the primary, from which secondary pleasures stem. I'll enter a monk mode then. Won't I need human interaction though? Sure, when we're ready for it and on a significant nofap. Commit to 2 weeks nofap/no ejaculation. We do not need sex at this time. We've had our fun, 7 bodies is plenty.

Just visiting the frat now, I notice myself making compromises. In macro behavior, I commit to one thing, to monk mode and a degree of social isolation. When thrust into circumstance, however, I hesitate, lingering and wanting to interact. Whatever I commit to, I must commit to. No social interaction apart from logistics and (arguable included in logistics) the necessary pleasantries of interaction. I need to isolate, I need time to find my own inner meaning and purpose separate from any purpose or woman. I need to find a favorite way to live which is wholly sufficient for all my needs, that I am independent and unreliant on others (or their body parts). 

	Further, I'm not going to try to sleep when I clearly can't – that's just a fucking nightmare. It seems daunting and not unbearable to us in forethought, but lets try working, coding.
