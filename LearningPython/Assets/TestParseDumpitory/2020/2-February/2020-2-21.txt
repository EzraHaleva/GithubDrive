2:27 pm

In stark contrast to some of the relaxation I felt earlier, I'm feeling full of energy but also impulsivity. Almost like a caffeine rush, but I only had a double shot in the morning like I always do. Perhaps this is a result of eating at maintenance calories as I have. As far as caring about whether it will affect the night, I think no bother and it seems I can focus on the present fairly easily if I try. And trying I'm now observing my stomach hurt perhaps slightly. Is there some activity we can do to be more relaxed, more calm? I don't feel quite good in all honesty. Alcohol should fix that when the time comes, but for now I think drink a lot of water. Also,  rest in bed a bit. Go for a walk maybe. Clean up your shit in main area too.
