12:56 am

I wasn't going to write a journal just now. I opened this document, closed it, and had a tab open to go to some other site, but felt a headache come on, a fatigue. All the busyness of the virtual world, of really most things external it seems, all seem meaningless. I'm approaching an almost nihilistic fatigue. If we can channel this fatigue into a disregard for all that, in truth, brings you no benefit and a then unapologetic regard and aggressive conquest for that which does give you benefit, that would be good. Otherwise this feeling might manifest into a nihilism and inevitable relapse. Further, we find ourselves bordering again on a general malaise of anger and resentment. “This is all shit anyway, the fuck would I care about you or anyone else? I know what I need to do to perhaps make this slightly more bearable, I'll do that in my peace.” But perhaps consider no one is out to get you, we're all pursuing the same thing really. You interact with them, and they interact with you. We are all the same variety of people, don't think you're any special or different. That bit I think is slightly relevant, but didn't go anywhere in the end. As far as practical steps, etc, and maybe I'm rushing this so as to settle things in my head and sleep peacefully, but it would be good to settle things no? Anyway, need we not fall back on the tried and true methods of benefitting our life? Wake up early, read, lift, cold approach, work hard, make your days fly by. Notice the one big glaring thing in our face, the cold approach. It's so bloody horrifying, it really always is. Logistically, how would I go to a mall? Where would I find time? Further, most of the girls at malls are young, perhaps too young? And our fundraising position – it's very easy. Do your best and if you flop, let the fraternity handle it. 

I'm too tired for now. Lets see if I'll be able to sleep yet.
