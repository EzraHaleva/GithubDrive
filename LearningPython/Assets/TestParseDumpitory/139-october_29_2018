It is clear to me now why a succesful man shouldn’t express his emotions carelessy. Like masturbation is the liquidation of sexual energy for delusional purposes, careless emotional expression is the liquidation of emotional energy for delusional purposes. Once it is expended it is no more. In my fit of joy from getting a 97 on my midterm, I lost all emotional energy of the joy. This joy should’ve carried me through my day, as I savored it silently and contently. The energy is not from expending, but from the option to expend it. It is as if in every moment you are expending it when you have the option to. Just as it is as you are eating every junkfood imaginable with immense pleasure when you are fasting. All expenditures, then, of any sort of emotion or pleasure should be savored and used only when appropriate, only when their value is needed. 

Also, I call this day 2 because I ate icecream and a dunkin donuts bagel item on Saturday night, though Saturday was a rather succesful day. ather succesful day. Also, in the sake of keeping this journal as a logically congruent documentation of my process of improvement, I’ll strictly enforce that 8pm is journal time.
