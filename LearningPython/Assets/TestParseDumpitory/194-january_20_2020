Last journal, when considering the interview, we said we felt the energy in our heart, and so did Hansika, our interviewer, and others at AT&T. We have the job. 

This is good, but in light of that high, however, we’ve fell into shit. Yesterday and today were pretty much exclusively unproductive days, and now school is coming up where we’ll just be busy all the time. Competitive coding is a great pursuit if we can study it in a meaningful way. 

The mantra is to keep doing. The less we do the more we crumble. The quality of what we do is almost negligible, so long as we seek to first do and then improve what we do. There is also, conversely, what we don’t do. For entertainment feed garbage is positively doing nothing, actively not doing.
