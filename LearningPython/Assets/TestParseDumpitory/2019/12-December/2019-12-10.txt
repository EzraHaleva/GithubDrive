12:37 pm

I tried to address my productivity, but perhaps the first problem I should address is my entertainment feed addictions. I can feel them fogging my mind and weakening my body, always tired without the “fix”. So we cut off the dopamine and embrace discomfort. Not just from internet use but from everything. 

9:58pm

Now I'm sick, and I was drawn towards watching movies, relaxing in bed, and eating garbage. Just because we're sick doesn't mean we sacrifice the mission. Unless there is legitimate reason to, continue not to consume garbage, continue to eat right, continue to do work when you can. Perhaps don't work out, but otherwise stick to the plan.
