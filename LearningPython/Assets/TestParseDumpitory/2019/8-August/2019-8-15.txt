On Tuesday night we had a bad relapse, but were able to save ourselves. Going from such a low, we've gotten a haircut today and with that new image has been allowed a new attitude. Cold approach went exceedingly well, and I am far more content with my appearance matching who I want to be. I especially wanted to document how we observed the a'beed approach, very masculine and demanding, and incorporated that into our own approach. When the girl is far away, don't walk towards her but say “come here”, even insist on it and they come. Very much frame control. 

I also want to address our work situation. There's no more point in trying to hide or feel bad about our lack of progress. Be honest about it and ready for conflict. I'm not taking any shit, I'm not apologizing. If they fire me so fucking well be it, I don't care. Do some work when your there, try and do what you can. That's all. Bring the c book for when you want to die. That's all we can do
