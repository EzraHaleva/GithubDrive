My sleep schedule has been pretty insane lately and I've been using it as an excuse to be mediocre in aspects. This is ok, tomorrow I start the whole working plan. Writing my expos essay has unexpectedly enough (since I thought they would be of zero value) provided me with a bit of a realization, a tiny one. The Above is true, with Wait, Do, and Consume, but separate from Do and perhaps filling a need for interaction or entertainment is Produce. The idea really bloomed after thinking on the consumerism of today, how we just buy and buy with no using. What I keep doing with information is essentially buying and buying, without using and appreciating what I have. I then, in addition to no consume, want to truly solidify that with not a quota but an allowance for Produce, in journal but also on Reddit. I feel giddy and excited, even though we should be nervous for exams, so that's good. God does his work.
