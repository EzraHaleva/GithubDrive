Wow, so quick and so insightful. He is right, I am focusing on marginal things that will magicaly make me better, but nothing will happen this way. I lose sight of motivation because there is no improvement. Suffering for the sake of it is not a goal in and of itself, it is not an achievement. Here is an achievement. Bench press 1.5x your body weight by next January. I currently weigh 170 pounds, if I lose weight that 150. Bench press 225 by January. 

Goals:

1) To weigh 150 pounds by the end of the semester (3 months). 

2) To be a week ahead of all my classes, while on track for a 4.0.

3) To have a morning routine of waking up at 5:30, praying, running 5 days a week, and then lifting for 3 days a week for 30 days, until March 20th

I've rediscovered a fire of perfection under me again. No more. No more. No more. Fuck that video, I don't need it, it will only serve to sap me of my convictions as so much immediate gratification has. For God, but also for me. I want to complete these goals so I am a better man, one able to utilize the faculties upon whom God bestowed me.
