Looking back on my past journals I see how far away contentment truly is. Even when disciplined, I'll still be unhappy. Even in the greatest successes, I reckon I'll still be unhappy. I perhaps should give up on happiness, perhaps even on contentment too. All the things I'm doing, I'm doing to pursue happiness or contentment, but perhaps I should accept everlasting discontent and cry out to God for salvation through good action.
