Journal Check in. Today was a slow start in getting up. It has been troubling me that I acted like a child last night at the meeting. I don't want to be a child. I want to be someone who has respect and doesn't need to act like a clown to garner other's attention. Fuck that, I must become content alone once again. Go into all of it as if you're not going to interact with anyone at all. I need a break for a week. If they come to you and control the conversation as if to tell me something, fine. Otherwise, my lips are bloody sealed.
