After just writing a damage report, I feel an urge to remind ourselves not to forget how close to relapse we always are. How a life of horror and regression is very close. Further, of how we derive such great pleasure from success, both physical and career wise. I see how this success is certainly the path to finally exercise the emotions which we by necessity repress. Never forget, you, as you currently are, are absolutely defective, incapable of securing a woman's love. This must be changed. It must, and the two known vehicles of this change in which we can place confidence are working out/dieting – perfecting our body, and being successful in our career – securing a respectable rank in society. May God help us, that we may upgrade our life condition yet.
