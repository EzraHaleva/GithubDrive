I didn’t journal last night because I was tired, but today is true day 1. Yesterday I was watching the fortnite videos on the bus with the kids and I finished avatar. It’s also been disturbing my tranquility that I haven’t put in the data for work. I must do that first thing today. Its harmful to my soul to maintain this stress. Otherwise I pray to God this will be a good streak now, where I finally and truly break free of nonsense once and for all. Break free. Also, I met and old Christian who started preaching to me about god, and I suppose it made me a bit nervous. Was it because I doubt Judaism or I am simply afraid of doubting Judaism? Should I investigate it further and purposefully doubt? No. I don’t think this is necessary. The doubt will disappear with study – it is only natural that sn educated person would have fewer grounds for proof than someone like daddy. That guy was searching for meaning though, not finding it. He created meaning from nothing, like all idolaters in the end. They’re too weak to perhaps face the desolate truth before facing the abundant truth.
