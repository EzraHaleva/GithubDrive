I ate some cereal with milk today although I was specially allowing myself some carbs. Tomorrow this stops, will gym Wednesday normal schedule.  I also didn't do any Hebrew homework or translation. Today was a busier day on top of seeing a need and working most of the time on restructuring the code once more, reorganizing the classes. This is causing me anxiety since I feel unsure of how to reorganize classes still. What responsibilities to what, what variables should I include in each new class, etc. Because I'm unsure, continue reading and finding sources. Ease your anxiety in the knowledge that this change is inevitable and doing it now is better than later. I will not have a 2000 line player class. It also seems fit I should make a sick regimen for when I'm sick and how to be most productive during that time. Still unsure of game reorganization as well.
