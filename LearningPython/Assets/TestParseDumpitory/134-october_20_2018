Success! I stayed with monk mode today. There were somethings I showed to friends and some wastes of time, but for the most part I stayed true and was productive. More of this please. Thank god. I’m rather tired and perhaps too tired to write something proper, but I’ll have something better to say tomorrow I imagine. This fatigue is actually quite good. I cannot concede on shabbat though, of all days concession on the most holy would be horrid. 

9:54 pm

As I tried to go to sleep ironically my fatigue left me and I suddenly was overcome with sadness. Am I so horribly inadequate that I have no friends, or rather no real friends. I don’t hang out with people, I’m not invited to chill. There’s just misery and sadness and misery and sadness. I talk to people and they talk to me, but our conversations lack meaning, are without substance. But what is this substance I am seeking? It all comes back to intimacy, I feel unloved. Yes, this is quite the terms for it. It is humiliating, a horror of horror. I seek to love others yet this love is never reciprocated. I now see. Love no one, no one but god and family I suppose. Fuck. I need monk mode. There will be no saving grace if I am a sad fuck my whole life. No saving grace at all. I’ll just be worse than everyone, with no reason to be worse. Just a trap of mediocrity, destined never to marry, destined to amount to nothing. That is what I’ll become I must rightfully fear. For now, perhaps, it’s essential to learn not to love. Perhaps psychopathy is necessary, to break from one extreme to the ultimate middle path. Starting now, we repress all warm feelings toward anyone. Manipulate and achieve, manipulate and achieve. No laughter, no interaction. This journal will be my friend. In other words, I alone will be the protagonist of my life, save family. You can be sad and yet psychopathic, we don’t need to be this sort of dick dadtardly. Simply sad, but caring not for others.
