There is too much uncertainty in the logistics of my life right now. I need to plan and organize everything, make a proper system so I can focus on whatâ€™s important. The demo must be finished by this week, period. Today I need to settle in entirely. I must have sleeping arrangements, a planned diet, and all of my stuff must be unpacked and in a place.
