Getting to sleep a little too late tonight, but it's alright. Mostly on schedule. Did well today, though still needing to figure out diet. What is committed is I'll still do keto, with mostly meat and follow Maimonides guidelines but more strict. Within keto and Maimonides I have free range. I've definitely got most of my super powers back as well. Also should update, on Shavuot I figured I would just relax and do nothing and it totally fucked me. Was tired all the time, actually got readdicted to videogames again which was ridiculous. I said that yesterday would be my day 1, ended up a day 0.
