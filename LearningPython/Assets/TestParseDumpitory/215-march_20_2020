We’re seemingly starting to come out of that strange funk. Still quite in the funk, but I can feel it alleviating slightly. I’m thinking it’s now time to revisit those old lessons of discipline. We need to find tangible tasks and do them, and they need to be ones related to alleviating this stress about our exams. 

First let us situate a hierarchy. First, study fully and completely for comparch to the extent we’re able with what we have right now. Do this studying on paper, perhaps dedicate to it a notebook. The same thing, then, for Info class. Then also for software meth, and finally catch up with algo. If all goes well, on Sunday we should have an additional session to reconfirm our knowledge and situate confidence in the material. This shouldn’t be necessary at all for info. A similar session should happen for software meth on Tuesday.
