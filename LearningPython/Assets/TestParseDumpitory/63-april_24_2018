I will call this a somewhat unintentional relapse, so though it doesn’t have the implication of consciously rejecting god as I have so foolishly in the past, it will have otherwise negative impacts on my health and mind. I played fortnite today, even though it was with friends, I have a headache and feel tired. No more fortnite. Also no more Instagram, I don’t even know why I allowed myself that. I must remember I’m not yet healed, I’ve only just begun to heal.
