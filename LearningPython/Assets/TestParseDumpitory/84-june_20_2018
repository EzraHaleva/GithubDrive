Well boys, these past two weeks have been rough to say the least. The derech has been lost in near totality. There are things I regret frustrations upon me, but the realm of purity I may have once glimpsed need not be out of reach. I must and can try to get it back. Let us go through what must be done. 

Food. Well, I’m skeptical of a fat based metabolism, so let us combine them w

With a plan. We know that working when hungry is good, so I say intermittent fasting is the way. 8 hour windows, with 3 meals of approximately 750 calories each. This way it will be controlled hunger. The restrictions will be general health as we know. Must have meat every day, must have fat every day, sugar from fruits, no processed carbohydrates besides natural breads, when out to eat we can order what we want, but it must be the closest dish to those items possible. 

Purity. Omegle must go, we know in our hearts it is wrong. But how, then, are we to fulfill our desires for people, our loneliness. Patience is a virtue, and we might befriend the past authors of time through reading their books. 

Productivity. We know it is scary and daunting. It doesn’t matter. What is scary now will be exciting later. Embrace it with every fiber of your being. 

Workout. Weight lifting daily. If tired we do a contrast shower or sleep.
