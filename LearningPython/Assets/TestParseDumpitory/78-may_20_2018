Dream, 8:24 an

On a different bus to philosophy, landscape is different. Looks almost like outside of a courthouse and inside uni is a shopping mall layout with ice cream shop inside. y my dad is here and wants to review classes I’m taking. I get there and end up up being hungry. Me and Richard and others go to a restaurant that is expressively homosexual, and someone in the group made a gay joke. We’re eating appetizers as they come to kick us out. I start scarfing down food because I’m hungry. I try and act nice throughout, then at the end I’m pushing it to finish my food, kind of refusing to leave the restaurant. They say something like “we were so happy, you were the nice one but now it comes out'. I come back to philosophy 7 minutes late and say “ah, 7 minutes not an issue” and go into class. My dad comes in with me and we try and sit but can’t find seats or can’t fit, so everyone turns their desks 90 degrees and teacher teaches from the side. My dad starts screaming quietly that I should apprentice with someone teaching a trade, and leaves. He was interested with the ice cream shop, wanted me to leave class to go make cones that are really tall soft serve. Teacher chastises one student about a single absence in their career, which makes me nervous as I missed a lot. I think I have classic liberal retard discussion with liberals about my dad, with sort of implication “those damn boomers don’t understand us, stuck in their old ways”. That’s all I remember. 

12:33 next day

I feel like, even though it's only day 2, I'm starting to get very mild super powers. I'm become relaxed and I'm hackying easily with friends.
