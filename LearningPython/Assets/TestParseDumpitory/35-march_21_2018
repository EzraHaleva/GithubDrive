So I’ve just gone on Reddit when I wasn’t supposed to and spent time on crap. On a side note though, I’ve realized, though not for the first time, that I’m assessing people’s value and then greeting them with a forced effort based on that value. I should be assessing who they are, and greeting them based on that. If some is looking needy I should be nice, if someone looks confident I should be happy. I also found myself to, again, be quite chirpy. Well, not true. Richard doesn’t like to talk at all, so when I talk to him I ignore that aspect. When he genuinely doesn’t want to talk, then I become annoying. So, I should allow him to talk to me, and engage him well, but from now I won’t prompt conversation.
