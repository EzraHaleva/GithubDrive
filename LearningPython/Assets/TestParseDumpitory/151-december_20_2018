From the wisdom of Pook I have made a revelation. When meditating, one is enabled to see their true nature, their buddha nature. But wait, one may ask, if one’s true masculine nature is to be that uncompromising idea we know is succesful with women, how can this be when typical buddha nature is not like this? How can one have compassion in this way? You fool! You great fool! You do not see compassion for it’s true nature. It is not compassionate to be nice to women, it is not compassionate to cater to them, to laugh at their jokes when they are not funny, to give them unearned kindnesses. Nor is this compassionate to do for a man. Should it be that people are rewarded for no merit? We know this reward, we are regretably familiar with it. The reward of no merit, pornography, has brought us nothing but sadness, nothing but deep debilitating depression. Do not reward a woman for doing something beyond your interests, for it is not in your nature to do so and, therefore, not within her nature to be rewarded. Reward without merit must be extended to those only in need. Just as honey is healthy to the sick, it is harmful to those of good constitution. Hold for all people the utmost compassion by rewarding them for nothing, by never compromising your own goals for theirs, by enjoying life in your true nature, without concern for theirs, for God in his perfection constructed us that your true nature will never compromise another individual. To be true to yourself is to be compassionate to all others. To be compassionate to your self is instrinsically coupled with being compassionate to others. We all win together, or we all lose, you more than others. To win for yourself, then, is to claim victory for all of humanity. Claim this victory. Embody your nature as a man. The desires of a man.
