The rules seem to be performing very well. Although I just ate and I’m going to go the the gym very soon. We’ll see the effect on my stomach. 

9:37 pm

I didn’t end up going to the gym, will go tomorrow morning after a rest and meat plate gives me strength, hopefully. I also noticed, again, I am fucking smooth as fuck. I can talk to people and I’m cool. Of course, once I got into dodgy territory with the whole reality thing it got a little out of hand, but now I need simply avoid such conversations until I’m knowledgeable proper. Knowing what I need to do is very simple now. I talk to people and have a good time and can tell that those who are awkward are below me in this scale. Though, some self reflection now, I shouldn’t think in such a way. No one is below me, we're all made in gods image, all with capabilities and so forth. Only those with improper values should be shunned. In a concluding note, life is good. Life is great, full of possibility. If only I was like this through highschool. 

4:12 next day

Woke up at 3ish and have for some reason been stressing about rutgers. I came up with a good essay idea though. To describe the process of finding a solution as a cat chasing the mouse. The essay could be titled “the little mouse in my brain”.
