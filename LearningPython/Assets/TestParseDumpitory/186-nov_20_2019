Journal Check in. I woke up sick today with a slightly sore throat. I won’t be going to the gym, but I need to make sure I don’t succumb to all the bullshit again. It’s better to get sicker physically than mentally. Every time I’m sick all my programs go down the tubes and I don’t even get that much better.
