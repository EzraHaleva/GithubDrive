I started my new diet where I eat healthy carbs. I think I ate too much though, next time should do less rice. 

12:32 next day

Didn’t get a ton done, but got some done. Tomorrow I’ll hopefully do even more. IAt the least I’m not disgusted with my progress. Healthy carbs is definitely the way to go though. I’m also stressed about Hebrew, but it is what it is. I can still get a good grade, and can still learn a sizeable amount of Hebrew in the coming two months. This week I really need to prioritize getting something going for the summer though. I want to give momzair flight info by the end of this week 100%.
