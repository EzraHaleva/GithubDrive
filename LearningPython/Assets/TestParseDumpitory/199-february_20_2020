Over the weekend I relapsed badly, and yesterday just played games and fapped last night. I’ve been good on the diet since the weekend though, and yesterday resolved to get my shit together by means of a sleep schedule. So I woke up at 5:30 yesterday, after going to sleep around 3 or 4, and slept well at 9pm last night, waking up today at 5:30. I’m now resolving to get my shit together by means of this journal, and investigating how we might now implement an optimal lifestyle, our sleep schedule being a foundation of that now set. 

Firstly, I feel much better waking up early. I feel awake and present, and the life progress also brings me some peace. We outlined in one of the last few journals that we want to read difficult things again. Effectively, perhaps its equivalent to studying. How then should we handle priorities? Maybe like gym? Assume it first being done, then work around that? No, I think it can be read casually. Fit in somewhere 30 minutes a day. Lets try right after morning journal. It’s not a late night cram thing, that’s more along the lines of school. 

To address entertainment feeds,  we really need to address that desire and urge to browse whatever, the illusion of connectedness. Satiate that desire for awareness by asking people of their experience. Ask them what’s new, ask them if they’ve heard anything interesting. Let their sphere of concern become your news source. This is how information is supposed to spread, it creates such a wonderous society. Technology has ruined that to an extent. So, then, when we are feeling an urge to know something or be entertained – ask someone about what’s going on. This doubly will improve your social skills and interactions. 

That’s it for today I think. I’m emotionally not so directed towards a task anymore, maybe I’m fatigued. When emotions don’t guide you, the best thing is to just do what you know is right I suppose.
