I woke up at 5:30 this morning and felt the same lack of conviction that has characterized my life since I relapsed from my morning routine, but likely was even present throughout everything. I asked myself again, why am I doing this. I then read the Tora for an hour or two, stopping after chapter 28 of bereshit. I answered this in my notes: 

Why am I doing this?

Why do i want to lose weight?

Why do i want to get good grades and master my subjects?

Why do i want to wake up at 5:30 every morning and pray, then have a fitness routine?



I will be honest here so that the path i take is accurate of the desires of my soul, so that ill stick to this path. There is a long tradition of men in my house, though my connection of them may have felt weak, it has always been strong. I am the son of their sons, an heir to the house of Jaacob. They are my tribe, and this tribe is one of honor, but God's honor. One of capability and righteousness. We've enacted a covenant with God to fulfill his misvot. In this fulfillment we achieve our ultimate actualization, prophecy. We will achieve an ultimate pleasure directly, intimately linked and as a result of that reality. Slowly, as we begin and continue to pursue prophecy and a closeness with God, we will see a healing of our soul, rhe restoration of our humanity we feel being lost. We may connect eith people, accepting them as the imperfect beings they are and not expecting of them beyond their means. There is a certain feeling now as if on the cusp of the end of a reality amd the beginning of a new one, bringing excitement for the future, coming with the light like a spring bearing the future. In truth, isn't every moment the end of a past and the beginning of a future?



With that being articulated I hope to maintain a motivation to keep to the misvot, encompassing all the positive and beneficial qualities/achievements I seek and more.
