Couldn’t wake up today at 5:30, woke up late at 9:30 and am only getting around to journal now. Today just focus on getting software meth work done, going to gym, keeping diet, and maybe doing some amazon returns. I don’t have any other insights left to make, really. Just tired, blank. Need to get back into discipline. 



9:31 pm

This is a sort of emergency journal entry. Things fell apart fairly bad. I contacted rodna to fuck, jerked off, overate slightly, and watched youtube and garbage all day. I got absolutely no work done for software meth. All we can really do is do the software meth work and go to sleep. Nothing else will heal us.
