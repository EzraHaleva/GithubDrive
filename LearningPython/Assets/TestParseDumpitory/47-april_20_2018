So today I was rather productive, did everything on the list except faur. At some point after coding for the third time today, I got very tired and looked at a specific youtube video that was in my head. I wanted badly to go on reddit but did not. Then I invited jae over for charoset and we ate charoset. I then had more after he left and chocolate spread. I then became very tired and was desperately craving reddit or any form of dopamine. I didn't partake, though I lied on my bed for a while and decided to write this journal. I feel better after starting to write this now. I think I'l investigate livestreaming. Once I get this code finished and cleaned, it's streaming time baby.

So I google streaming advice then watched a YouTube video then watched Jordan Peterson. Intrinsically I don’t think there is an issue with those videos but I know in my heart I shouldn’t have. It was because I was tired and couldn’t do work, and that’s because I wasn’t disciplined and ate charoset. Eat only what your soul requires, till 3/4ths full. This is when I’m most productive. This is how I progress. Accept that after 3/4ths hunger you won’t be eating anymore, for at least 2 hours. That’s new rule, in addition to limited carbs with every meal and sweet only at beginning or first meal. I also feel as if I may have a wet dream tonight and I won’t. I keep saying it, but I’m unsure of whether or not I’m fathoming it. I will not have a wet dream. If presented with an opportunity for sex I will decline, for my life is too valuable to be hindered by short term pleasures. I have no need for such idols when the grace of God is before me, and I before him. It is so important I make progress with the prayers. Without them I am lost.
