So I have been steeped in relapse over the past few days. This has led me to incorporate punishment into this next attempt. Incorrect behavior is punished with a water fast, for every incorrect thought I must take a cold shower for 1 minute. Today I thought 5 times about biting my nails, once about sex, once about an omegle girlfriend, once about videogames, starting singing music to myself once, and thought about movies once. This totals 10 minutes of cold showering at the end of the day. Even just ensuring my thoughts are always on what is at hand, I find myself more relaxed and more like what I envision a sage to behave like in superficial matters. I've also done other things like relegate all internet use besides directions and communication of irl people to my computer. Before I could check youtube or look up a tutorial on my phone, now I cannot. If I'm doing this correctly, it shouldn't be hard. Once you actually realize the truth your physiology conforms to that truth and the urge is gone. If It is hard it means I have fucked up, and I'm undoing something of the past. This is where the defenses come in.
