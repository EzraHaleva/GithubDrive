I meandered a little bit in the hot shower and in the morning, but did alright following monk mode. I had planned on eating way to late and became ravenous after programming so I ate a matza with 2 eggs and then one with peanut butter and Nutella, not great. Regarding nofap I’ve been totally urge free, which is good. I really think it’s important I finish and fix the code for the algorithm tomorrow at the latest, or else my productivity if truly wavering. I’ll give myself infinite time to finish it, with set breaks only for eating. 

3:58 pm

I went to the shook and got a fruit juice. I’ve also sampled some pastries. Now my stomach hurts and I feel tired. No more sugar. Rule is can only eat carbohydrates in a meal with protien.

I would have for sure gone on Reddit had I not stopped myself, and then my night would have been a waste like many others. Though I wasn’t so productive in the end, I did not regress, and thank God I am still in reality. I’ve been in the moat so long that holding myself out of it so very difficult. After long though, I will become at home in reality. Additionally I skipped Hebrew and faur tonight. I feel justified in skipping faur because I’m genuinely fatigued and will sleep, the Hebrew was just that it’s uncomfortable. Again, discomfort is not bad but good, it is to be embraced. Try again tomorrow. If I fail, then I will bring up Hebrew again when I am situated in reality and able to withstand discomfort on Sunday. I sincerely hope I need not wait a week to do my Hebrew, but if necessary I must succeed in long term, even if it imparts short term stress.
