Was feeling sick today after tubi last night – very sick. No more alc when sick. Also, I’m allowed to get with gs when out, but no more than that. Even still, it Shou be about for actually getting to know people. I also spent most of today doing nothing truly productive. I hecke slept until 11, then went on Reddit and looked at nofap videos on YouTube. Then I ate cereal and carbs. I can eat carbs in the meal, but under no circumstances can I eat cake. I don’t eat desserts, sorry. I’ll spend the time with reading and discussion.
