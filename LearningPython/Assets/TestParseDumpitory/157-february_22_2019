It’s been a few days since I’ve started my new goal focused program. The largest difference now is my diet, where I eat little and savor every bite. I've also started to really push myself in being productive. I try to do work every day, and though I'm not meeting all of my quotas, I’m meeting some of them. For example, though it was difficult I finished reading expos today, which took about 2 hours because of the inefficiency and inability of my focus. That is something to work on every day. 

I'll also mention that I feel my mind healing. I wrote on Reddit about how I felt dead, emotionally disconnected and without emotion to motivate my behavior. Now, my emotions are being restored. This is a result, I think, from disengaging with sources of immediate gratification, most notably food, and also through the consideration and visualization of tangible goals, emotion then being incited by past experience suggesting what it might feel like to achieve them.
