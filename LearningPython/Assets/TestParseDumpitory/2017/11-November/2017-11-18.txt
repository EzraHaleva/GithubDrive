Day 0, 

I fapped tonight. I need more mental data, nofap could still be an unnecessary product of monk mode, with a large downside of constantly thinking of sex all the time. Right now I feel very tired, though it is quite notable I experienced horrible pain after ejaculation. I feel more prepared now for Monk Mode take two. Next Shabbat I will make a decision on whether or not to maintain nofap. This time, I must 100% meditate every day. I believe the activation of the genius is necessary to direct the energy in the above theory to the mind. Monk mode is certainly the future. Looking back, it was a vital first step.
