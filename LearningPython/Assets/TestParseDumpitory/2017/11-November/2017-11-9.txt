Day 8, 

I've made what appears to me to be a profound epiphany. I'm far too focused on attaining women and that is exactly what will inhibit me from doing so. A woman will judge a mate based on a perceived approximation of their life. In a constant underlying pursuit of a mate, one is impeding whatever other goals in life they are pursuing and will, thus, not complete those goals as effective to the standard. One must simply live their life in the most successful or satisfying way possible and mates will come naturally, as creating a coherent and fulfilling existence improves the mentioned approximation evaluation. 

Its later in the night now. I'm fairly drunk but actually quite depressed instead of happy, seemingly more so than I was before drinking but hindsight about the same. I came on this trip with the idea in mind that I'd be accompanying Lucy on the bus, etc. I wouldn't say I have feelings for her in a romantic way, however I do very much enjoy her company.
