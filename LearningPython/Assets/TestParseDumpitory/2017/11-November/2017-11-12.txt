Day 11, 

I came in my sleep last night but further I ate junk food, went on twitter on the bus, and indulged in bullshit. It all must correlate. Strength of the groin is strength of the palate is strength of the mind. It is time to apply the more abstract principle behind monk mode. Unproductivity, in any means, must be eliminated. Being with friends, past the extent of maintaining and strengthening relationships, is unproductive. A kibbutz trip is unproductive. Lolli gagging in the shook is unproductive. Even this journal is in large part unproductive. The main concept can no longer be “not to do this” but “you must do this and those things impede that goal”. 
Idea: begin to analyze and develop a theory for social interaction among teens. Conceive (or really observe) the incentives and goals behind social action and apply a sort of game theory to that.
