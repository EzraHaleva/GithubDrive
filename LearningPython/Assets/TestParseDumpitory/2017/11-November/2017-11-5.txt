Day 4, 

I began writing my college essay. It has the necessary elements of a thesis, body, etc. but feels empty and badly usual. The topics I'm writing about are lacking meat, I think that ultimately is a necessity because of the word limit. Instead of trying to make profound statements with little words, of trying to fit your entire being into a small essay, it's likely better to talk about one more meat moment or to briefly touch upon many things into an overarching conclusion that is evident from the content itself.
