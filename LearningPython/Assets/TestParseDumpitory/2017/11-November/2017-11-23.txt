Day 4 

7 habits is getting juicy. Proactivity, referring to internal onus of control, is an obvious habit but it's distinct acknowledgement is probably beneficial. Also, I'm scared that these valuable habits may not resonate, that in thinking about them I'll naturally be inclined towards other bullshit self-improvement schema and thus the entire concept will collapse as nonsense in my head. Perhaps I should tread carefully, thinking in very basic logical abstractions. I've seemingly lost what initial intuition I had of my thinking in the matter. I've thought of something else just now though. Sort of in line with daily planning, I can articulate what I can do that day to benefit myself. My success thus far has been reactive to negative emotions. Instead of working to be rid of negative emotions resulting from stagnation and poor life projections I can work for positive benefits of good feelings upon being productive. This would change self-betterment from a negative to positive benefit, which would make it more consistent This makes the most sense, it's interesting to me why I haven't realized this till now.
