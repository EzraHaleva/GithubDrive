8:33 am
day 1

I'm especially optimistic about this new strategy of fixing my garbage life. Already I'm at the bus stop and have nothing to do, so I naturally go to make a journal. Perhaps this isn't as productive as reading a hard book, but it is better than browsing crap. “An interesting note” – stop conforming to fit into a stereotype mold of what you imagine your ideal self-embodying. The human is complex, the ideal will just be, not exist as some mental heuristic or predictable interaction patterns-  just there (referring to the previous sentence starting with perhaps) I caught myself conforming to a previously observed bullshit speech format. “Perhaps I haven't done x, and maybe perhaps I haven't done y, but I've done something that superficially relates to some wholesome aspect of human living and behavior, thus all external observers must acknowledge the 'holy' nature of this deed and use that deed to justify the entire act being described. “ 
I'm noticing my mind isn't clearer in terms of mental fog, but more relaxed. Things feel empty, vanilla. The multicolored hurried worries of whatever I'm doing to entertain myself are gone. 

Act in a way that acknowledges a superior role within an expected hierarchy. The minds of people you talk with should naturally assume this hierarchy and then acknowledge and respect your status.
