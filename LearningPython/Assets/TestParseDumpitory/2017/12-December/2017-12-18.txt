Rule 1, No Distractions:

I was doing quite well earlier today, but as I progressed on completing my Talmud paper I went on Facebook for an hour than talked to Ellie and Evie for another hour and a half, getting to sleep very late.

Solution: do a concise greeting then unapologetically say “I can't talk right now, but I want to catch up after I finish this paper”. Further, if mentally fatigued, take a walk or sleep. Do not go on Facebook, Jewish argument is unproductive all the same. 

Rule 2, Health: 

I got to sleep quite late because I was talking to Ellie and then Richard. Again, unapologetically say I need to go to sleep, let's talk on the morning. Articulate this need but acknowledge that you want to engage with them.

Rule 3, Productivity:

I did programming and Hebrew, though I grew tired and disenfranchised towards the end, then I did Talmud paper. I ultimately got it done, though I wasted time. Again, take a walk or sleep. If something is wrong, acknowledge it and find a solution. Do not just sit there and Facebook, or go get a snack or something – that's another form of Facebook. 

Overall

Rule 1- did crap, need to address problems and stand my ground. Even if tired, you must not conversate before work. 

Rule 2 – got to sleep late, same principle as above

Rule 3 – I got my work done, but could do more.
