Rule 1) I again spent some hours in the morning on bullshit. New rule, when I wake up in the morning I either a – go back to sleep, b – immediately make a hot drink, or c- do 10 pushups. I also find myself on Facebook just when I feel dead and it seems like a decent thing to do. I should stop this, even though I'm getting my work done, it is still unhealthy. I can check Facebook for specific events and note if they are achieved. Otherwise, I must go for a walk, just to laundry and back. This means if I have a craving for Facebook I either work or walk. Also, I find myself getting hot drinks and the such during work when something doesn't feel right. These should be prepared in advance. Caffeinated tea is permitted at all times now for this purpose. 



Rule 2) Ate a few too many carbs, maybe 150g, otherwise it was fine. The number itself is not exact so no pressure, but no more than that. It should be centered on 125 still. Also, need to better plan my workouts with my meals. 4 hours minimum between protein and workout. 



Rule 3) Didn't finish Hebrew in time, largely because It seemed an insurmountable-esque task. In the future, immediately when you get home vet if the homework given is good. If not, make your own with disk and texts in aleph book. Listen to the disk and read the text on bus rides and such. Also, am adding translation to daily thing, 30 min. It thus must be accomplished first thing when I get out, after programming.
