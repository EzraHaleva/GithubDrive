Win Hoff, or perhaps monk mode 2, has made me more in tune with my mind again. I questioned what I'm waiting for, and it occurred to me yet again I'm waiting for value in my life. I still haven't done anything meaningful, and on a side note a girlfriend wouldn't change that. I need to make money. Value as determined by dollars someone else is willing to pay for what I produce. Sure, I wrote an essay, but grades aren't giving me value. Sure im working out, but unless I want to work in construction I still don't have value. I have the long term tools to work towards a life of value, but at present am producing nothing to pay back the debt of societal investment. I imagine when I first make money, not within an employee job for I would likely encounter the same issue, but within producing a product that others value, that I will experience great euphoria. It can't be just some product, however, it must be something that I am uniquely good at, something that utilizes my genius. This reaction is based in that it helps me achieve something of the truest value, intelligent children with ample opportunity.
