Just a thought, all ideas are only truly understood when they are at the highest level of abstraction possible without losing any significant details. If two ideas can be consolidated into a broader level of abstraction while still specifying those specific things, then our prior understanding was limited. If I know of apple only as apple and not as fruit or food or organic matter etc. I don’t understand as well as I would knowing those concepts. Similarly, if I know a behavior, say smiling, as only the act of smiling and not as a more abstract principle of being happy, I don’t understand smiling. This understanding of understandings is necessary for how to win friends influence people. Ultimately, Carnegie describes a surface behavior. Yes, he describes the mental state of the performer, but not the natural motivation behind the performance. This motivation is the principle. Applying concepts of 7 habits and this book, identify the principles using Carnegie and assume those principles using 7 habits
