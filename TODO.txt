Assorted computer related TODO: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

- Script that searches through file system, likely this GithubDrive,  finds the path to files commonly accesed by my scripts (often sourced rc  files, bash scripts, or python scripts), and loads these paths to a number of enviroment variables specific to each file. Then whenever accessing one such file, the program will access its corresponding env var and won't break if I move things around

-set up environment shortcuts to launch frequently used apps, like terminal or file manager

-Make journal app more of an encapsulated program. perhaps a command line app that we can launch with :journal, and then with a shortcut. Once app is launched, then we have options of n - new entry, e - edit entry, s - save (to github), x - exit. On journal exit we automatically save. on  journal entry we automatically pull. 

- shoof different distros, see what we'll want. Probably something higher level and then stripped. 

- configure a custom terminal build, of either xterm or st or some other  terminal emulator. Also with maybe fish shell?

- switch to neovim

For dspwm to be well usable:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- configure a custom xterm, just with the aesthetics we need. 

- actually make a background

- set up our desirable mappings for basic tmux like functionality

- set up poly bar with any easily obtainable essentials

- set up mappings to launch and focus on frequently used applications
